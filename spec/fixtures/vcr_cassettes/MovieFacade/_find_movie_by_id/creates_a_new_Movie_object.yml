        the latest Disney musical extravaganza, preaches the importance of embracing
        your true nature but seems to be at odds with itself.\r\n\r\nThe animated,
        3-D adventure wants to enliven and subvert the conventions of typical Disney
        princess movies while simultaneously remaining true to their aesthetic trappings
        for maximum merchandising potential. It encourages young women to support
        and stay loyal to each other—a crucial message when mean girls seem so prevalent—as
        long as some hunky potential suitors and adorable, wise-cracking creatures
        also are around to complete them.\r\n\r\nIt all seems so cynical, this attempt
        to shake things up without shaking them up too much. \"Frozen\" just happens
        to be reaching theaters as Thanksgiving and the holiday shopping season are
        arriving. The marketing possibilities are mind-boggling. And in the tradition
        of the superior \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Little Mermaid,\" surely
        \"Frozen: The Musical\" will be headed to the Broadway stage soon. The songs
        – which are lively and amusing if not quite instant hits—are already in place.
        \r\n\r\nLittle girls will absolutely love it, though. That much is undeniable.
        And the film from co-directors Chris Buck (\"Surf''s Up\") and Jennifer Lee
        is never less than gorgeous to watch. A majestic mountaintop ice castle is
        particularly exquisite—glittery and detailed and tactile, especially as rendered
        in 3-D.\r\n\r\nBut first we must witness the tortured backstory of the film''s
        princesses – not one, but two of them. The script from \"Wreck-It Ralph\"
        co-writer Lee, inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen story \"The Snow Queen,\"
        has lots of cheeky, contemporary touches but is firmly and safely rooted in
        Scandinavian fairy tale traditions.\r\n\r\nWhen they were young girls, sisters
        Anna and Elsa were joyous playmates and inseparable friends. But Elsa''s special
        power—her ability to turn anything to ice and snow in a flash from her fingertips—comes
        back to haunt her when she accidentally zaps her sister. (Not unlike the telekinesis
        in \"Carrie,\" Elsa inadvertently unleashes her power in moments of heightened
        emotion.) A magical troll king heals Anna and erases the event from her memory,
        but as for the sisters'' relationship, the damage is done.\r\n\r\nElsa''s
        parents lock her away and close down the castle, which devastates the younger
        Anna. (Of the many tunes from \"Avenue Q\" and \"The Book of Mormon\" songwriter
        Robert Lopez and his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the wistful \"Do You Want
        to Build a Snowman?\" is by far the most poignant.) But once they reach adolescence
        and it''s Elsa''s turn to take over the throne at age 18, the two experience
        an awkward reunion.\r\n\r\nThe perky, quirky Anna (now voiced by a likable
        Kristen Bell) is a little nervous but overjoyed to see her sister. The reserved
        and reluctant Elsa (Broadway veteran Idina Menzel) remains distant, and with
        gloved hands hopes not to freeze anything and reveal her true self on coronation
        day. But a run-in with an amorous, visiting prince (Santino Fontana) who sets
        his sights on Anna triggers Elsa''s ire, and she inadvertently plunges the
        sunny, idyllic kingdom into perpetual winter.\r\n\r\nFlustered and fearful,
        Elsa dashes away in a fit of self-imposed exile – which significantly weakens
        \"Frozen,\" since she''s the film''s most complicated and compelling figure.
        On her way to the highest mountain she can find, Elsa belts out the power
        ballad \"Let It Go,\" her version of \"I Am Woman.\" This soaring declaration
        of independence is the reason you want a performer of Menzel''s caliber in
        this role, and it''s the film''s musical highlight. (Her flashy physical transformation
        from prim princess to ice queen does make her resemble a real housewife of
        some sort, however.)\r\n\r\nAfterward, though, the story settles in on Anna''s
        efforts to retrieve her sister and restore order to the kingdom. Along the
        way she gets help from an underemployed ice salesman named Kristoff (Jonathan
        Groff) and his trusty reindeer sidekick, Sven. They all meet up with a singing
        snowman named Olaf (a lovably goofy Josh Gad, star of \"The Book of Mormon\"
        on Broadway) who dreams of basking in the warmth of the summer sun. This \"Wizard
        of Oz\"-style quartet makes the obstacle-filled trek to the imposing fortress
        that awaits. (At least \"Frozen\" has the decency to borrow from excellent
        source material.)\r\n\r\nWhile the journey may seem overly familiar, the destination
        has some surprises in store. Some come out of nowhere and don''t exactly work.
        But the biggie—the one that''s a real game-changer in terms of the sorts of
        messages Disney animated classics have sent for decades—is the one that''s
        important not just for the little girls in the audience, but for all viewers.

        you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nSix
        years later, and Frozen has left an undeniable cultural impact. From Let It
        Go to tons of merchandising, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee delivered such a
        memorable film that people not only didn’t forget but regularly asked for
        its sequel. As of right now, Frozen II has claimed the third-best animated
        opening weekend ever, proving that the love for this franchise (I think it’s
        safe to call it that already) is strong. However, how great is the original
        movie, after all? To be honest, I never fully watched it until this past week
        in preparation for its sequel. It surprised me in the sense that I didn’t
        expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Frozen is deserving of the love it possesses.\r\n\r\nWith
        extremely captivating characters, the story flows naturally, and the entertainment
        levels are always high. Whether these are due to the amazing singing sequences
        or to the exciting adventures, this film never stops having fun. That’s what
        Frozen ultimately is: a lighthearted, fun, and entertaining movie. It follows
        Disney’s formula for creating a variation of a story we have seen before.
        Characters go through a traumatic event when they’re young. They have to grow
        up while struggling with the aftermath of said trauma. Eventually, they overcome
        that obstacle and live happily ever after (or at least until the next installment).\r\n\r\nIt’s
        the generic and somewhat cliche Disney model for a new animated film (franchise).
        Nevertheless, don’t get me wrong: it works perfectly. Sure, it doesn’t bring
        anything new story-wise, but it’s still a great time. Despite some unnecessary
        and lazy exposition (the magical trolls are basically exposition devices),
        Frozen still delivers a truly captivating and visually jaw-dropping narrative.
        I do need to emphasize this: the animation is phenomenal. Elsa’s magic is
        seamless and beautiful. Arendelle is a gorgeous location, and the snowy mountains
        are impressively designed. Let It Go will always be remembered for its lyrics
        and melody, but the actual animated sequence is astonishing.\r\n\r\nEvery
        character carries a lot of expressiveness, which allows them to do basically
        everything. Frozen might not be a groundbreaking movie, but its compelling
        characters make the generic plot work. From Elsa and Anna’s complicated but
        heartwarming relationship to Kristoff and Sven’s camaraderie, I care about
        all of them… especially Olaf. I know, Olaf is simply the snowman version of
        a comic-relief character. He doesn’t really have a complex arc in need of
        extreme development. However, it’s impossible not to love him. He’s such a
        welcome presence in every single scene. Every single line of his is either
        a funny remark or a pretty valuable insight into something.\r\n\r\nCounting
        him out, every other character has a very well explored arc, mainly Elsa and
        Anna. Their (older) relationship originates from a plot point that might be
        a tad exaggerated, but it’s convincing enough. Finally, the score is as important
        as it is fantastic. It’s an animated musical, let us not forget about that.
        Obviously, Let It Go is the queen of all songs due to its catchy lyrics, memorable
        chorus, and significance to the character. But other ones such as Do You Wanna
        Build a Snowman and For the First Time in Forever also carry a sweet melody
        plus some exquisite character and story development. That’s what I love the
        most about musicals and why Disney always triumphs regarding this aspect:
        the way a simple song can tell so much about someone or move the plot forward.
        In my opinion, it’s the genre’s variation of “show, don’t tell.”\r\n\r\nIn
        the end, Frozen might not be a groundbreaking animated film story-wise, but
        it delivers around 100 minutes of pure fun and entertainment. With an exceptional
        voice cast (Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, and Josh Gad are wonderful), Chris
        Buck and Jennifer Lee are able to take Disney’s formula and create a worthy
        variation of the classic blueprint. From the emotionally compelling and well-developed
        characters to the eyegasmic animation quality, Frozen is a good time from
        start to finish. Boasting some memorable and catchy songs, it became one of
        the decade’s culturally most impactful animated movies. I wish exposition
        wasn’t overused, and that more risks were taken concerning the screenplay,
        but as a Disney animated flick, it meets the company’s standards.\r\n\r\nRating:

        really did blow up when it was released, and rightly so. Sure it probably
        got overhyped but that isn''t the film''s fault. It''s a cracking watch, the
        pacing is absolutely spot on as are the musical numbers.\r\n\r\nWhat impresses
        me the most about the music is that it manages to keep the storytelling alive
        whilst it occurs. Particularly at the beginning there are loads of songs squeezed
        in next to each other, which could mess with the premise building but it doesn''t
        - it actually enhances it. The songs themselves are terrific, with \"Let It
        Go\" obviously getting the most plaudits.\r\n\r\nIdina Menzel (Elsa) and Kristen
        Bell (Anna) are excellent in the lead roles, while Josh Gad almost steals
        the show as Olaf - very funny character! Of course it''s aimed at the younger
        audience members, but it is still entertaining for us adult folk too - I''ve

        so it took me ten years and a persistent nephew to finally sit down before
        this, and though I didn''t hate it, I really did struggle to see what all
        the fuss was about. It''s a colourful adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson''s
        \"Snow Queen\" story that sees Queen \"Elsa\" leave her kingdom after she
        almost kills her sister \"Anna\" - she has the ability to turn all before
        her to ice and that can be perilous at times for those around her! As she
        flees, upset, she accidentally leaves all in her kingdom with a rather frosty
        predicament. It now falls to \"Anna\" alongside her friendly snowman and her
        reindeer to try and get this pesky curse lifted. It skips along amiably enough
        with plenty of charming animation - especially from \"Olaf\" the snowman,
        but it''s really about that one song that Edina Menzel delivers with a skill
        that, for my money anyway, is comfortably the best of these anthemic Disney
        power-ballads. I''m not sure even legendary lyricists Don Black and Richard
        Stilgoe have ever managed to incorporate \"fractals\" into their songs! As
        with so many of HCA''s fairy tales, there is a darkness to the story - this
        one sanitises these aspects a little too much for me, but that said it still
        deals with issues of fear and deceit well enough for folks to get the message
        that perhaps having a frozen heart is not just a physical thing. Ten years
        on, it''s still a decent watch that I suspect will continue to sustain youngsters
        for many a year to come.","created_at":"2022-08-02T06:45:45.675Z","id":"62e8c8197caa47005e86fb63","updated_at":"2022-08-02T06:45:45.766Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62e8c8197caa47005e86fb63"},{"author":"Andre

        the latest Disney musical extravaganza, preaches the importance of embracing
        your true nature but seems to be at odds with itself.\r\n\r\nThe animated,
        3-D adventure wants to enliven and subvert the conventions of typical Disney
        princess movies while simultaneously remaining true to their aesthetic trappings
        for maximum merchandising potential. It encourages young women to support
        and stay loyal to each other—a crucial message when mean girls seem so prevalent—as
        long as some hunky potential suitors and adorable, wise-cracking creatures
        also are around to complete them.\r\n\r\nIt all seems so cynical, this attempt
        to shake things up without shaking them up too much. \"Frozen\" just happens
        to be reaching theaters as Thanksgiving and the holiday shopping season are
        arriving. The marketing possibilities are mind-boggling. And in the tradition
        of the superior \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Little Mermaid,\" surely
        \"Frozen: The Musical\" will be headed to the Broadway stage soon. The songs
        – which are lively and amusing if not quite instant hits—are already in place.
        \r\n\r\nLittle girls will absolutely love it, though. That much is undeniable.
        And the film from co-directors Chris Buck (\"Surf''s Up\") and Jennifer Lee
        is never less than gorgeous to watch. A majestic mountaintop ice castle is
        particularly exquisite—glittery and detailed and tactile, especially as rendered
        in 3-D.\r\n\r\nBut first we must witness the tortured backstory of the film''s
        princesses – not one, but two of them. The script from \"Wreck-It Ralph\"
        co-writer Lee, inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen story \"The Snow Queen,\"
        has lots of cheeky, contemporary touches but is firmly and safely rooted in
        Scandinavian fairy tale traditions.\r\n\r\nWhen they were young girls, sisters
        Anna and Elsa were joyous playmates and inseparable friends. But Elsa''s special
        power—her ability to turn anything to ice and snow in a flash from her fingertips—comes
        back to haunt her when she accidentally zaps her sister. (Not unlike the telekinesis
        in \"Carrie,\" Elsa inadvertently unleashes her power in moments of heightened
        emotion.) A magical troll king heals Anna and erases the event from her memory,
        but as for the sisters'' relationship, the damage is done.\r\n\r\nElsa''s
        parents lock her away and close down the castle, which devastates the younger
        Anna. (Of the many tunes from \"Avenue Q\" and \"The Book of Mormon\" songwriter
        Robert Lopez and his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the wistful \"Do You Want
        to Build a Snowman?\" is by far the most poignant.) But once they reach adolescence
        and it''s Elsa''s turn to take over the throne at age 18, the two experience
        an awkward reunion.\r\n\r\nThe perky, quirky Anna (now voiced by a likable
        Kristen Bell) is a little nervous but overjoyed to see her sister. The reserved
        and reluctant Elsa (Broadway veteran Idina Menzel) remains distant, and with
        gloved hands hopes not to freeze anything and reveal her true self on coronation
        day. But a run-in with an amorous, visiting prince (Santino Fontana) who sets
        his sights on Anna triggers Elsa''s ire, and she inadvertently plunges the
        sunny, idyllic kingdom into perpetual winter.\r\n\r\nFlustered and fearful,
        Elsa dashes away in a fit of self-imposed exile – which significantly weakens
        \"Frozen,\" since she''s the film''s most complicated and compelling figure.
        On her way to the highest mountain she can find, Elsa belts out the power
        ballad \"Let It Go,\" her version of \"I Am Woman.\" This soaring declaration
        of independence is the reason you want a performer of Menzel''s caliber in
        this role, and it''s the film''s musical highlight. (Her flashy physical transformation
        from prim princess to ice queen does make her resemble a real housewife of
        some sort, however.)\r\n\r\nAfterward, though, the story settles in on Anna''s
        efforts to retrieve her sister and restore order to the kingdom. Along the
        way she gets help from an underemployed ice salesman named Kristoff (Jonathan
        Groff) and his trusty reindeer sidekick, Sven. They all meet up with a singing
        snowman named Olaf (a lovably goofy Josh Gad, star of \"The Book of Mormon\"
        on Broadway) who dreams of basking in the warmth of the summer sun. This \"Wizard
        of Oz\"-style quartet makes the obstacle-filled trek to the imposing fortress
        that awaits. (At least \"Frozen\" has the decency to borrow from excellent
        source material.)\r\n\r\nWhile the journey may seem overly familiar, the destination
        has some surprises in store. Some come out of nowhere and don''t exactly work.
        But the biggie—the one that''s a real game-changer in terms of the sorts of
        messages Disney animated classics have sent for decades—is the one that''s
        important not just for the little girls in the audience, but for all viewers.

        you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nSix
        years later, and Frozen has left an undeniable cultural impact. From Let It
        Go to tons of merchandising, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee delivered such a
        memorable film that people not only didn’t forget but regularly asked for
        its sequel. As of right now, Frozen II has claimed the third-best animated
        opening weekend ever, proving that the love for this franchise (I think it’s
        safe to call it that already) is strong. However, how great is the original
        movie, after all? To be honest, I never fully watched it until this past week
        in preparation for its sequel. It surprised me in the sense that I didn’t
        expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Frozen is deserving of the love it possesses.\r\n\r\nWith
        extremely captivating characters, the story flows naturally, and the entertainment
        levels are always high. Whether these are due to the amazing singing sequences
        or to the exciting adventures, this film never stops having fun. That’s what
        Frozen ultimately is: a lighthearted, fun, and entertaining movie. It follows
        Disney’s formula for creating a variation of a story we have seen before.
        Characters go through a traumatic event when they’re young. They have to grow
        up while struggling with the aftermath of said trauma. Eventually, they overcome
        that obstacle and live happily ever after (or at least until the next installment).\r\n\r\nIt’s
        the generic and somewhat cliche Disney model for a new animated film (franchise).
        Nevertheless, don’t get me wrong: it works perfectly. Sure, it doesn’t bring
        anything new story-wise, but it’s still a great time. Despite some unnecessary
        and lazy exposition (the magical trolls are basically exposition devices),
        Frozen still delivers a truly captivating and visually jaw-dropping narrative.
        I do need to emphasize this: the animation is phenomenal. Elsa’s magic is
        seamless and beautiful. Arendelle is a gorgeous location, and the snowy mountains
        are impressively designed. Let It Go will always be remembered for its lyrics
        and melody, but the actual animated sequence is astonishing.\r\n\r\nEvery
        character carries a lot of expressiveness, which allows them to do basically
        everything. Frozen might not be a groundbreaking movie, but its compelling
        characters make the generic plot work. From Elsa and Anna’s complicated but
        heartwarming relationship to Kristoff and Sven’s camaraderie, I care about
        all of them… especially Olaf. I know, Olaf is simply the snowman version of
        a comic-relief character. He doesn’t really have a complex arc in need of
        extreme development. However, it’s impossible not to love him. He’s such a
        welcome presence in every single scene. Every single line of his is either
        a funny remark or a pretty valuable insight into something.\r\n\r\nCounting
        him out, every other character has a very well explored arc, mainly Elsa and
        Anna. Their (older) relationship originates from a plot point that might be
        a tad exaggerated, but it’s convincing enough. Finally, the score is as important
        as it is fantastic. It’s an animated musical, let us not forget about that.
        Obviously, Let It Go is the queen of all songs due to its catchy lyrics, memorable
        chorus, and significance to the character. But other ones such as Do You Wanna
        Build a Snowman and For the First Time in Forever also carry a sweet melody
        plus some exquisite character and story development. That’s what I love the
        most about musicals and why Disney always triumphs regarding this aspect:
        the way a simple song can tell so much about someone or move the plot forward.
        In my opinion, it’s the genre’s variation of “show, don’t tell.”\r\n\r\nIn
        the end, Frozen might not be a groundbreaking animated film story-wise, but
        it delivers around 100 minutes of pure fun and entertainment. With an exceptional
        voice cast (Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, and Josh Gad are wonderful), Chris
        Buck and Jennifer Lee are able to take Disney’s formula and create a worthy
        variation of the classic blueprint. From the emotionally compelling and well-developed
        characters to the eyegasmic animation quality, Frozen is a good time from
        start to finish. Boasting some memorable and catchy songs, it became one of
        the decade’s culturally most impactful animated movies. I wish exposition
        wasn’t overused, and that more risks were taken concerning the screenplay,
        but as a Disney animated flick, it meets the company’s standards.\r\n\r\nRating:

        of Disney''s best, in my opinion. Not quite top tier, but very close.\r\n\r\n<em>''Frozen''</em>
        really did blow up when it was released, and rightly so. Sure it probably
        got overhyped but that isn''t the film''s fault. It''s a cracking watch, the
        pacing is absolutely spot on as are the musical numbers.\r\n\r\nWhat impresses
        me the most about the music is that it manages to keep the storytelling alive
        whilst it occurs. Particularly at the beginning there are loads of songs squeezed
        in next to each other, which could mess with the premise building but it doesn''t
        - it actually enhances it. The songs themselves are terrific, with \"Let It
        Go\" obviously getting the most plaudits.\r\n\r\nIdina Menzel (Elsa) and Kristen
        Bell (Anna) are excellent in the lead roles, while Josh Gad almost steals
        the show as Olaf - very funny character! Of course it''s aimed at the younger
        audience members, but it is still entertaining for us adult folk too - I''ve
        watched it a few times down the years and still thoroughly enjoy it.","created_at":"2020-08-31T13:25:38.561Z","id":"5f4cfa52223a8b0037af2261","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:43.641Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f4cfa52223a8b0037af2261"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"OK,
        so it took me ten years and a persistent nephew to finally sit down before
        this, and though I didn''t hate it, I really did struggle to see what all
        the fuss was about. It''s a colourful adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson''s
        \"Snow Queen\" story that sees Queen \"Elsa\" leave her kingdom after she
        almost kills her sister \"Anna\" - she has the ability to turn all before
        her to ice and that can be perilous at times for those around her! As she
        flees, upset, she accidentally leaves all in her kingdom with a rather frosty
        predicament. It now falls to \"Anna\" alongside her friendly snowman and her
        reindeer to try and get this pesky curse lifted. It skips along amiably enough
        with plenty of charming animation - especially from \"Olaf\" the snowman,
        but it''s really about that one song that Edina Menzel delivers with a skill
        that, for my money anyway, is comfortably the best of these anthemic Disney
        power-ballads. I''m not sure even legendary lyricists Don Black and Richard
        Stilgoe have ever managed to incorporate \"fractals\" into their songs! As
        with so many of HCA''s fairy tales, there is a darkness to the story - this
        one sanitises these aspects a little too much for me, but that said it still
        deals with issues of fear and deceit well enough for folks to get the message
        that perhaps having a frozen heart is not just a physical thing. Ten years
        on, it''s still a decent watch that I suspect will continue to sustain youngsters
        for many a year to come.","created_at":"2022-08-02T06:45:45.675Z","id":"62e8c8197caa47005e86fb63","updated_at":"2022-08-02T06:45:45.766Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62e8c8197caa47005e86fb63"},{"author":"Andre
