        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays
        from Keanu.\r\n\r\nMr Wick spends the rest of the film getting even with a

        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore
        that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting
        all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot
        deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there
        is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance
        does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were
        a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally
        work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action
        and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films
        is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count
        with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.
        There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered

        entertainment, this.\r\n\r\nHappy to have finally got around to watching this
        franchise! I expected sheer enjoyment and that''s what I got. <em>''John Wick''</em>
        is good fun! It is more hammy than I thought it would be, not that that''s
        a criticism. Some characters duck out surprisingly abruptly too (justice for
        Clarke Peters!), even when the one who should get taken out immediately somehow
        manages to stick around for a while.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves is always a pleasure
        to watch act. His character is a badass, that''s for sure. If I''m being truthful,
        none of the others stood out to me too much - not in a negative way, just
        moreso they are all on the same level as each other behind Reeves. Willem
        Dafoe is the best of the rest, though.\r\n\r\nI look forward to checking out
        the sequels, which I''m expecting positive things from - especially with,
        presumably, bigger budgets.","created_at":"2023-02-17T17:59:49.161Z","id":"63efc09535818f0085ea0fa3","updated_at":"2023-02-17T18:00:41.345Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63efc09535818f0085ea0fa3"},{"author":"Rob","author_details":{"name":"Rob","username":"Arcanum101","avatar_path":"/w7CFzleuBl2EMBEl08fSA14aUOy.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"Simply

        am the future!\r\n\r\nClass of 1984 is directed by Mark Lester and Lester
        co-writes the screenplay with Tom Holland and John Saxton. It stars Perry
        King, Roddy McDowall, Merrie Lynn Ross, Timothy Van Patten, Stefan Arngrim,
        Michael Fox, Roddy McDowall and Lisa Langlois. Music is by Lalo Schifrin and
        Alice Cooper and Cinematography by Albert J. Dunk.\r\n\r\nNew music teacher
        Andrew Norris (King) is shocked to find the pupils of Lincoln High rule the
        roost. Refusing to kowtow to Peter Stegman''s (Patten) gang of thugs, he decides
        to fight back...\r\n\r\nIt''s always tricky revisiting later in life films
        that have cemented themselves as cult favourites. Class of 1984 is one such
        cult favourite of many who eagerly digested it back in the early half of the
        1980s, a time when censorship was rife and banning orders the order of the
        day. The word of mouth back then was that Lester''s film pushed boundaries,
        a frightening vision of a future where education as we know it would be replaced
        by anarchy, the youths of the day running amok with violence, sexual aggression
        and copious amounts of drugs. was this an astute portent by Lester and his
        crew?...\r\n\r\nEssentially this marks one of the turning points in the trashy
        filmic timeline of films dealing in educational establishments collapsing
        within via youth rebellion. Where the likes of Blackboard Jungle kicked things
        off with grim textures, Class of 1984 picks up the baton and urinates on it
        with a glint in its eye - for better or worse. As a whole the pic is given
        over to being ridiculous for the sake of shock value, yet it''s strangely
        magnetic, managing to strike a nervous chord. Exploitation? No not really,
        that was just a marketing ploy that worked...\r\n\r\nViewing it these days
        it looks part of a tired formula, but that in no way should denigrate the
        importance of it, for it helped turn the tide in said formula. Ultimately
        it becomes a visceral revenge thriller, where some scenes are well constructed,
        others not so much, with the finale outrageously over the top. The acting
        from the younger cast members is mostly ok, though Patten is difficult to
        take serious as the gang leader. King is splendidly committed to the lead,
        garnering our support, while McDowall is the class act on show.\r\n\r\nLurid
        colours, eye splinter fashions and a rocky sound track round it out as a trashy
        \"B\" movie of much ebullience. One for the nostalgic amongst us for sure,
        but also for film historians interested in the sub-genre this sits in. 7/10","created_at":"2018-12-09T07:34:27.373Z","id":"5c0cc583c3a368252009d2f5","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:22:19.328Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5c0cc583c3a368252009d2f5"},{"author":"GenerationofSwine","author_details":{"name":"","username":"GenerationofSwine","avatar_path":"/xYhvrFNntgAowjRsf6mRg9JgITr.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"It''s
        2020 and, frankly, I miss movies like this.\r\n\r\nHollywood has tanked, they
        really aren''t putting out anything worth watching any longer... and it''s
        debatable if Class of 1984 is really worth watching. I guess it depends on
        your mood.\r\n\r\nBut we need that padding back. We need a whole bunch of
        ridiculous, low budget exploitation films to pad and help finance the bigger
        ones. That might actually stop Hollywood from actively attacking the people
        that didn''t go see the trash movies they spent millions on and still tanked.\r\n\r\nBecause,
        honestly, I''m not going to spend $25 a ticket to go see a gender and race
        swapped remake of a beloved childhood lecture with a heavy handed one sided
        political message and no real story or plot.\r\n\r\nBut I will spend a few
        bucks to stream a trash exploitation movie, with no real message, no real
        budget, and a plot that was made to just be fun and entertaining.\r\n\r\nClass
        of 1984 is one of those movies, one of the movies where you can sit back and
        just be entertained for an hour without having to suffer through anything
        that you''re not allowed to make fun of because... meh politics.\r\n\r\nThis
        is the type of movie where it''s almost encouraged that you make fun of it...
        while you are watching it. This is the home movie market, where you don''t
        view it in theaters because a little audience participation makes for a better
        viewing experience.\r\n\r\nThis I will pay to see on a rainy weekend.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot sucks, it stars the funny dude from Rip Tide, and its over the top and
        silly... in other words, it''s escapist entertainment. And ENTERTAINMENT is
        what movies should be all about","created_at":"2023-01-11T01:25:54.606Z","id":"63be1022f85958007d3744a3","updated_at":"2023-01-11T01:25:54.699Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63be1022f85958007d3744a3"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2}}'

        see a red door and I want to paint it black!\r\n\r\nStir of Echoes is written
        and directed by David Koepp who adapts from the novel of the same name written
        by Richard Matheson. It stars Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Zachary David Cope,
        Illena Douglas, Jennifer Morrison, Kevin Dunn and Conor O''Farrell. Music
        is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Fred Murphy.\r\n\r\nChicago
        phone engineer Tom Witzky (Bacon) submits to being hypnotised by his sister-in-law
        and finds that his young son''s imaginary friend is not imagined after all...\r\n\r\nUndeniably
        lost in the slip-stream of the similar themed \"The Sixth Sense\", Stir of
        Echoes screams out to be seen by more fans of supernatural mysteries. It''s
        a near faultless production, with Koepp getting all the key ingredients right
        on both the page and in transfer to the screen. Pacing is often the problem
        with films of a similar ilk, but Koepp deftly structures it in three engrossing
        sections.\r\n\r\nFirst third establishes the main characters and the supernatural
        set-up, but the bonus here is that character reactions are believable, especially
        with Erbe''s confused wife. Koepp has a great sense of atmosphere whilst ensuring
        we are fully immersed in Tom Wizky''s new world of disorientation by way of
        terrifying visions and red light shocks. Second third brings the chills and
        the odd boo-jump, again the director is aware that too many jumps can overkill
        the plot, so they are nicely spaced out and accompanied by a palpable fear
        of the unknown. Then the last third unravels in a whirl of Roy Neary like
        obsessions and ghosts of the past denouements. It''s a standard formula, yet
        it''s amazing just how often film makers get it wrong, especially in horror.
        Not a problem here. \r\n\r\nFilm is further boosted by Newton Howard''s score
        that blends the ethereal with rising thunder and Murphy''s colour photography,
        the latter of which helps to paint a harmonious Chicago neighbourhood, soon
        to be turned upside down, literally at one end of the street. The acting is
        super, which in Bacon''s case is a given to anyone who has followed his career,
        and Koepp shows some nice and creepy visual filming techniques to further
        enhance the great Richard Matheson''s story. There''s the odd little misstep,
        such as a thread involving a secret organisation that has the \"gift\" of
        being \"open\" to the supernatural, that feels like filler to over state Tom''s
        torment. While the post reaction to a suicide attempt isn''t given nearly
        enough screen time to really add impetus to the unfolding mystery. But small
        complaints only, for Stir of Echoes (great title) remains a truly involving
        and entertaining supernatural mystery. 8.5/10","created_at":"2019-10-16T23:11:30.698Z","id":"5da7a3a2944a57001323c9f0","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:22:25.476Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5da7a3a2944a57001323c9f0"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}}'

        Guest'' is a surprisingly fun throwback to 1980s horror. It boasts a thumping
        soundtrack and quick cuts that really fit into the theme of the film. The
        exaggerated scenes of violence and gore may be a bit too strange for those
        who do not appreciate the sentimentality and nostalgia of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe
        narrative is very straightforward and follows Dan Stevens, an ex-soldier,
        as he returns to his friend''s family''s house as a dying wish. He protects
        and helps them through their individual problems but all is not what it seems.
        The film does lose it''s way slightly towards the end as it tries to drastically
        remind audiences that the film is meant to be over-the-top when it was already
        doing a subtly good job.\r\n\r\nDan Stevens is very good in the main role.
        From the trailer, it looked like it would be a rip-off of Nicolas Winding
        Refn''s ''Drive'' but Stevens adds a very unique coldness to his powerful
        persona.\r\n\r\n★★★½","created_at":"2017-03-09T15:03:48.417Z","id":"58c16ed4c3a3687da8005c5f","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:55.433Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58c16ed4c3a3687da8005c5f"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2}}'

        slasher is entertaining**_  \r\n\r\nIn the San Francisco area, five girls
        in 6th Grade reject a boy’s polite offer to dance with one of them falsely
        accusing him of assaulting her. Thirteen years later, when they’re all about
        25 years-old, the women start receiving macabre valentines before their gruesome
        deaths. Who’s killing them and why?\r\n\r\n\"Valentine\" (2001) was made by
        the director of “Urban Legend” (1998), which gives you an idea of what to
        expect. Like “Urban Legend” and the overrated “Scream” (1996), there’s a wink
        of parody, but it’s done better and is actually amusing, not to mention disappears
        by the second half. \r\n\r\nUnlike those flicks, “Valentine” wasn’t successful
        at the box office, but I like it better. Sure, it’s a standard slasher with
        the tropes thereof, but I enjoyed it from beginning to end. It’s similar in
        tone to “April Fool’s Day” (2008), just superior. \r\n\r\nThe notable female
        cast includes: Marley Shelton (Kate), Jessica Capshaw (Dorothy), Katherine
        Heigl (Shelley), Jessica Cauffiel (Lily), Denise Richards (Paige) and Hedy
        Burress (Ruthie). On the other side of the gender spectrum there’s David Boreanaz
        (Adam), Fulvio Cecere (Detective Vaugn) and Daniel Cosgrove (Campbell).    \r\n\r\nThe
        rockin’ soundtrack is good, featuring acts popular at the turn-of-the-century,
        like Rob Zombie, Disturbed, Linkin Park, Deftones and so forth.\t \r\n\r\nThe
        film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia,
        and Riverview Hospital in nearby Coquitlam. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-","created_at":"2022-03-23T19:03:57.306Z","id":"623b6f1da34911005dc430d2","updated_at":"2022-03-23T19:03:57.306Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/623b6f1da34911005dc430d2"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}}'

        mess of a sequel***\r\n\r\nSix years after Michael Myers previously terrorized
        Haddonfield, Illinois, ‘the Shape’ returns in pursuit of his niece, Jamie
        Lloyd, who has escaped some shadowy Druid cult with her newborn. Marianne
        Hagan and Paul Rudd play the main protagonists while Donald Pleasence returns
        for his last portrayal of Dr. Loomis. Mitchell Ryan and Kim Darby are also
        on hand. \r\n\r\n“Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers” (1995) is also known
        as “Halloween 6,” but it’s actually only the fifth movie featuring Michael
        Myers seeing as how “Halloween 3: Season of the Witch” (1982) is totally disconnected
        from the Michael Myers story arc.\r\n\r\nI’m a fan of “Halloween 4” (1988)
        and “Halloween 5” (1989), especially the former, as it was actually better
        than the original movie (1978) and is one of the finest examples of 80’s slashers.
        Naturally I was expecting a quality sequel but, wow, this installment lacked
        any sense of cinematic finesse whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe entire opening act is
        a tortuous mess and the story didn''t even start to get interesting until
        past the 50-minute mark. Unfortunately, it failed to build on what little
        interest it mustered, trading it in for conventional horror thrills at a hospital
        à la “Halloween 2” (1981). But the characters are too weakly developed to
        care about; it’s like the ‘writer’ had no concept of how to establish characters
        or even tell a compelling story. Meanwhile the sudden-shock scares that kept
        surfacing were eye-rolling hackneyed and anything but scary.\r\n\r\nThis installment
        was the equivalent of Conan the Barbarian picking up an expensive guitar and
        trying to play for a classy prog band like Opeth.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1
        hour, 27 minutes and was shot in Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-","created_at":"2018-11-07T15:08:51.974Z","id":"5be30003c3a36810c6016c00","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:14.259Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5be30003c3a36810c6016c00"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2}}'

        classic showcasing many wonderful artists.\r\n\r\nFrank McCloud is in the
        Florida Keys to visit the widow and father in law of an old war buddy, whilst
        at the hotel they run, he finds it has been taken over by gangster Johnny
        Rocco and his thugs.\r\n\r\nThe cast, the performances, the screenplay, tight
        direction, the photography and on it goes to give us a bona fide entry into
        1940s classics. It never ceases to amaze me how well Key Largo stands up on
        repeat viewings, each viewing bringing something new to my ever keen eye.
        This latest viewing brought me abundant joy in observing the background acting
        of the supporting players, not one of them looking on waiting for the director
        to shout CUT, each adding greatly with intense facial mannerisms - check out
        some of the background stuff Thomas Gomez does for example. Ah intense, what
        a truly befitting word to use as regards John Huston''s direction here, perfectly
        capturing the stifling heat of Largo and coupling it with the sweltering tension
        inside this run down hotel.\r\n\r\nKey Largo is often thought of as the lesser
        film from the Bogart/Bacall production line, which in fairness is against
        some pretty special opposition. Maybe we do lose the sexual chemistry of the
        mighty duo here? but in its place is a mano-mano face off teetering on the
        brink of explosion, Edward G Robinson''s weasel Rocco in danger of becoming
        a loose cannon to McCloud''s staid drifter, the atmosphere is palpable as
        this room full of hate and mistrust starts bubbling towards boiling point.\r\n\r\nHumphrey
        Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Edward G Robinson, Lionel Barrymore, Claire Trevor
        (Academy Award Winner Best Supporting Actress), Thomas Gomez and Harry Lewis
        are all excellent, all benefiting from master director Huston molding them
        together. Whilst Karl Freund''s deep focus photography perfectly encapsulates
        the mood of the piece. I just love Key Largo so much, from a heart tugging
        singing for your drink scene, to a retreating in the shadows shot of Bacall,
        Key Largo is one of the reasons I became a cinema obsessive. 9/10","created_at":"2014-08-28T03:13:45.282Z","id":"53fe9e690e0a262deb003257","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:22:05.071Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/53fe9e690e0a262deb003257"},{"author":"Nutshell","author_details":{"name":"Nutshell","username":"nutshell","avatar_path":"/vbGDgzstdmkxCSpHWcekq5o6pfh.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"A

        storm is about to break over Key Largo, but that''s nothing compared to the
        emotional eruptions going on inside James Temple''s run-down hotel, where
        the crippled old proprietor, his daughter-in-law, and a disillusioned ex-GI
        are being held up by the notorious gangster, Johnny Rocco.  What does he want?  Well,
        to put in his own words, he wants \"more\".  And his temper, as well as his
        gun, could very well go off at any given moment.  Mr. Temple, you might want
        to stop antagonizing him.  This brilliant, tense noir is, in my opinion, one
        of master director John Huston''s best.  Considered by some to be one of the
        lesser Bogie/Bacall pairings, it''s still a superb film that you don''t want
        to miss.  Some of the movie''s best moments are (1) Claire Trevor, as Rocco''s
        alcoholic moll, desperately singing for the sadistic Rocco and hoping to be

        an hurricane rapidly approaching, \"Frank\" (Humphrey Bogart) visits \"Temple\"
        (Lionel Barrymore) - the wheelchair-bound father of his late wartime buddy
        at his hotel only to find that it''s temporarily under new management. \"Johnny
        Rocco\" (Edward G. Robinson) is a fleeing gangster and he''s taken up residence
        while his escape is being organised. Needless to say there is a delicate dynamic
        at their hotel - with his friend''s widow \"Nora\" (Lauren Bacall) treading
        on eggshells and Claire Trevor frequently stealing the scene as the drunken
        moll \"Gaye\". It''s an hugely atmospheric thriller this. The sparing, pithily,
        delivered dialogue and the great use of the audio helps build this tension
        here aided by a strong effort from Barrymore; Bogart in his best less is more
        mode and Robinson doing what he did best - and here, quite effectively too.
        There''s on-screen chemistry a plenty and a denouement that rounds things
        off with a deadly confrontation! Film-noir at it''s best, this and if you
        can see it on a big screen then do.","created_at":"2023-10-20T07:38:37.081Z","id":"65322e7db2681f00c44e9842","updated_at":"2023-10-20T07:38:37.203Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/65322e7db2681f00c44e9842"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":4}}'

        Psycho\r\n\r\nDressed to Kill is directed and written by Brian De Palma. It
        stars Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen, Keith Gordon and Dennis
        Franz. Music is by Pino Donaggio and cinematography by Ralf D. Bode.\r\n\r\nBrian
        De Palma continues his commitment to Hitchcock thrillers with this erotic
        and lurid slice of entertainment pie. Plot in short order finds a razor wielding
        blonde woman on the loose in the city. A high class prostitute, a psychiatrist
        and the son of a victim try to solve the mystery before they themselves fall
        to the blonde killer.\r\n\r\nDe Palma throws it all at the audience here,
        merrily pushing people''s buttons as he goes. He uses all the tools and tricks
        of his trade for maximum impact, blending a number of genre staples and churning
        out a hyper stylised neo-noir that gleefully toys with audience expectations.
        Oh the plot is bonkers, deliriously so, but De Palma is a crafty pro who deftly
        marries up the excesses of the plot with virtuoso camera work, and not content
        with that he then brings Donaggio''s musical score into play to ensure the
        viewer''s senses are tingling.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly for the director, Dressed
        to Kill is sexually charged and violent, from the steamy beginning that ruffled
        feathers in a number of quarters, to the outrageous coda at the end where
        De Palma homage''s himself, it''s a film revelling in its schlocky being.
        However, it still has time for dramatic suspense and dangerously sensual mysticism,
        reference an extended section of film that sees Allen''s hooker pursued relentlessly
        through the perils of the subway system, and a sequence played out at an art
        gallery without dialogue as we become Dickinson''s disoriented eyes. Then
        there is the key murder scene, a dizzying array of slashes and cartoonish
        blood, it''s purposely excessive and followed by screw tightening suspense
        that sets up the rest of the movie.\r\n\r\nDe Palma and his on form principal
        cast members are having fun, how could they not with such trashy material
        to work from? Is Dressed to Kill phobic and misogynistic? Well plenty of people
        think so, in fact there was quite a fall out when the film was first released,
        when De Palma was subjected to the ire of a few minority groups. Judge for
        yourself is the only way to go really, but personally in amongst the schlock
        I feel there''s comment on the dangers of fantasising beyond your realm, or
        of unfaithfulness, maybe even that America is itself irresponsible for its
        treatment of women on film? Of course it could just be De Palma at his most
        playful? Sitting there giggling to himself as others lose their cool… 8/10","created_at":"2014-02-14T06:56:52.441Z","id":"52fdbe34c3a3684e3f12cc5f","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:22:03.554Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/52fdbe34c3a3684e3f12cc5f"},{"author":"slayrrr666","author_details":{"name":"","username":"slayrrr666","avatar_path":null,"rating":7.0},"content":"Following
        a housewife’s brutal murder, the only witness to the incident teams up with
        the woman’s son to try to find the culprit which leads them to the patient
        of a psychiatrist who treated her and tries to stop the killer from striking
        them in order to cover the crime.\r\n\r\nThis one turned out to be quite the
        rather enjoyable effort. A lot of the film’s great parts come from the manner
        in which this one deals with the expectations featured here of the film by
        following so close to its influences. As it follows so close to the main format
        here, as the general structure employed here comes directly with the structure
        of having the first half focus solely on the victim to get killed off and
        then morph over into the investigation into the incidents, that makes for
        a great deal of fun here as it deals with the few changes to be had with the
        storyline. That familiarity lends itself a great deal to the overall manner
        in which this one moves along as that keeps this one a lot more entertaining
        than it really should be without a whole lot of slashing action throughout
        here. With a big emphasis on the murder investigation and her involvement
        in the procedure, there’s a nice emphasis here to follow up the later adverts
        of that ones’ followers in a distinctly European manner by introducing not
        only the main investigation from the police but also going rather nicely into
        the amateur investigation by way of a piece of evidence only briefly glimpsed
        during the incident that becomes a central part of the investigation. These
        elements all give it a rather distinct and pronounced atmosphere to these
        brands of films which really lets it dwell in that type of sleaze far more
        comfortably than would be expected, not only from the type of nudity but also
        the rather stark sex scenes and frequently intoned psychosexual themes from
        the killer’s motivation which is straight out of that particular school of
        thriller which makes this one connect quite well there. Even with some incredibly
        well-done stalker scenes, including the opening attack in the elevator, the
        subway sequence or the finale at the office which give this some rather suspenseful
        stalking as well to balance it all with plenty to like. These don’t help the
        fact that there’s just not a whole lot of slasher action here, as the more
        thriller aspects here dominate this one so it doesn’t have a lot of stalking
        scenes and the body count itself is so low as to not really offer much in
        the way of bloodshed or gore. Those looking for a straight-up slasher won’t
        be interested in this one at all.\r\n\r\nRated R: Extreme Graphic Language,

        Hitchcockian crime thriller set in the heart of the Big Apple_**\r\n\r\nA
        sexually frustrated housewife in Manhattan (Angie Dickinson) does something
        foolish, which leads to a crime witnessed by an upscale prostitute (Nancy
        Allen). A therapist (Michael Caine), a detective (Dennis Franz) and a whiz
        kid (Keith Gordon) help try to solve the case.  \r\n\r\nHelmed by Brian De
        Palma, \"Dressed to Kill\" (1980) is a psychological drama/thriller in the
        tradition of Hitchcock. You’ll see bits borrowed from “Rear Window,” “North
        by Northwest,” “Psycho” and De Palma’s own “Carrie.” Some of the subway sequences
        are reminiscent of “The Warriors” from the year prior. Speaking of which,
        there’s a cartoonish, over-the-top quality to the proceedings that smacks
        of “A Touch of Evil.” The theme revolves around sexual lust, such as the carnal
        need of some women to feel desired, as well as male arousal. If that turns
        you off, I suggest staying away.\r\n\r\nThis was made before the ADHD era
        and so the film takes its time in telling its story. For instance, the creative
        art museum sequence in the first act lasts 9 minutes and features zero dialogue,
        which arguably could have been done in less than half the time. While I didn’t
        personally mind it, most modern viewers will find it tedious and unnecessary.
        The same could be said of the curiously elongated ending which, again, I didn’t
        mind.\r\n\r\nNancy Allen was De Palma’s new wife during shooting in 1979,
        a marriage that would only last until 1983. He tastefully illustrates her
        beauty despite her character being a hooker, although some have criticized
        her scenes in black lingerie as “softcore porn.” She appears in the other
        De Palma films “Carrie,” “Home Movies” and “Blow Out.”\r\n\r\nIt’s best to
        go into this without knowing much else. The ending features a surprising twist
        that wouldn’t be done today for reasons of “political correctness” (rolling
        my eyes).\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in Manhattan
        with the art museum sequence done in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B","created_at":"2023-10-24T20:31:13.049Z","id":"653829917fcab300eab3f8fd","updated_at":"2023-10-24T20:31:13.207Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/653829917fcab300eab3f8fd"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":4}}'

        it doesn''t have that actual thriller elements of the original, but that''s
        completely reasonable. Once you see Chucky go full force for the first time,
        it''s pretty hard to try and reel him back in to a \"Is he or isn''t he\"
        mystery for the sequels. And even if it is a step down from the first _Child''s
        Play_, getting to watch new characters experience their \"I was so wrong I
        died\" moments is always a cause for glee.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★ - I liked
