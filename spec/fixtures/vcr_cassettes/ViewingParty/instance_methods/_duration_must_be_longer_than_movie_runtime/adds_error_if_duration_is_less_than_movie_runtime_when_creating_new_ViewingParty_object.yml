        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays
        from Keanu.\r\n\r\nMr Wick spends the rest of the film getting even with a

        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        Wick is the definition of a blockbuster action film, with big set pieces and
        visceral stunt work that will leave audiences gasping. While the story and
        performances are lacking, the creators make attempts at establishing a greater
        world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore
        that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting
        all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot
        deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there
        is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance
        does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were
        a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally
        work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action
        and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films
        is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count
        with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.
        There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered
        by a pistol. I would have loved to see a little bit more variety, but it was
        so in-your-face and absurd that I still had a great time with it.\r\n\r\nScore:

        entertainment, this.\r\n\r\nHappy to have finally got around to watching this
        franchise! I expected sheer enjoyment and that''s what I got. <em>''John Wick''</em>
        is good fun! It is more hammy than I thought it would be, not that that''s
        a criticism. Some characters duck out surprisingly abruptly too (justice for
        Clarke Peters!), even when the one who should get taken out immediately somehow
        manages to stick around for a while.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves is always a pleasure
        to watch act. His character is a badass, that''s for sure. If I''m being truthful,
        none of the others stood out to me too much - not in a negative way, just
        moreso they are all on the same level as each other behind Reeves. Willem
        Dafoe is the best of the rest, though.\r\n\r\nI look forward to checking out
        the sequels, which I''m expecting positive things from - especially with,
        presumably, bigger budgets.","created_at":"2023-02-17T17:59:49.161Z","id":"63efc09535818f0085ea0fa3","updated_at":"2023-02-17T18:00:41.345Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63efc09535818f0085ea0fa3"},{"author":"Rob","author_details":{"name":"Rob","username":"Arcanum101","avatar_path":"/w7CFzleuBl2EMBEl08fSA14aUOy.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"Simply
        a cool character doing a lot of very bad things for all the right reasons.
        Immensely slick and incredibly fluid action in this movie. But the subtleties

        more than a hundred watches I still have to skip that puppy scene.","created_at":"2023-05-09T18:49:18.906Z","id":"645a95ae6aa8e000ff5be484","updated_at":"2023-05-10T15:51:14.526Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/645a95ae6aa8e000ff5be484"},{"author":"Andre
