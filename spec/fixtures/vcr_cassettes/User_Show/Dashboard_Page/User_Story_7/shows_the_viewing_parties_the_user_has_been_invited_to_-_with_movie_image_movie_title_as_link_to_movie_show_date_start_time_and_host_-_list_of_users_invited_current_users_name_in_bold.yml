        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays

        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        Wick is the definition of a blockbuster action film, with big set pieces and
        visceral stunt work that will leave audiences gasping. While the story and
        performances are lacking, the creators make attempts at establishing a greater
        world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore
        that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting
        all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot
        deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there
        is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance
        does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were
        a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally
        work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action
        and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films
        is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count
        with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.
        There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered
        by a pistol. I would have loved to see a little bit more variety, but it was
        so in-your-face and absurd that I still had a great time with it.\r\n\r\nScore:

        entertainment, this.\r\n\r\nHappy to have finally got around to watching this
        franchise! I expected sheer enjoyment and that''s what I got. <em>''John Wick''</em>
        is good fun! It is more hammy than I thought it would be, not that that''s
        a criticism. Some characters duck out surprisingly abruptly too (justice for
        Clarke Peters!), even when the one who should get taken out immediately somehow
        manages to stick around for a while.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves is always a pleasure
        to watch act. His character is a badass, that''s for sure. If I''m being truthful,
        none of the others stood out to me too much - not in a negative way, just
        moreso they are all on the same level as each other behind Reeves. Willem
        Dafoe is the best of the rest, though.\r\n\r\nI look forward to checking out
        the sequels, which I''m expecting positive things from - especially with,
        presumably, bigger budgets.","created_at":"2023-02-17T17:59:49.161Z","id":"63efc09535818f0085ea0fa3","updated_at":"2023-02-17T18:00:41.345Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63efc09535818f0085ea0fa3"},{"author":"Rob","author_details":{"name":"Rob","username":"Arcanum101","avatar_path":"/w7CFzleuBl2EMBEl08fSA14aUOy.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"Simply

        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        SPOILERS~\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is an excellent revenge action movie that raises
        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays
        from Keanu.\r\n\r\nMr Wick spends the rest of the film getting even with a
        mob boss for the actions of his son who killed his dog and stole his car.   As
        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films
        like this, they are a rare breed these days!","created_at":"2017-02-25T06:04:18.793Z","id":"58b11e62c3a368075a00616a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:55.050Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58b11e62c3a368075a00616a"},{"author":"Shreyance

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        wife made me watch the John Wick series when #3 came out... and I started
        with #3. She was pretty sure that I needed to watch the first two to understand
        what it was about... I was pretty sure that I didn''t.\r\n\r\nTurns out I
        was right. You don''t need to watch 1 and 2 to understand everything that
        is going on in 3. You don''t have to watch 1 to understand 2.\r\n\r\nYou can
        really jump in anywhere you want, and be up to speed withing a few seconds.
        The plot is really that paper thin.\r\n\r\nYou''ve seen movies with plots
        like this before. The tough guy that is the best at what he does goes out
        for revenge. It could be the plot from Taken... from any movie really.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot doesn''t matter.\r\n\r\nWhat matters is stylized nonstop action. The
        action is hard, fast, and it looks really, REALLY cool.\r\n\r\nThe story is
        absolutely nothing to write home about, but it''s not important to the movie
        anyway. That''s not where the fun is. Everything is paper thin, everyone knows
        it is paper thin....\r\n\r\n... because we all realize that this is a start-to-finish
        action extravaganza and things like plots and stories in movies like this
        only really get in the way. Too deep and the movie starts to stink.\r\n\r\nSo,
        what you have is really fun, really exciting, really cool looking action...
        and it''s entertaining. It''s OK to admit that it''s low on plot, because....
        it is what it is, and what it is is super fun and super entertaining.","created_at":"2023-01-11T01:31:12.122Z","id":"63be11605be00e00e7a2839f","updated_at":"2023-01-11T01:31:12.225Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63be11605be00e00e7a2839f"},{"author":"Nathan","author_details":{"name":"Nathan","username":"TitanGusang","avatar_path":"/yHGV91jVzmqpFOtRSHF0avBZmPm.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"John
        Wick is the definition of a blockbuster action film, with big set pieces and
        visceral stunt work that will leave audiences gasping. While the story and
        performances are lacking, the creators make attempts at establishing a greater
        world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore
        that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting
        all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot
        deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there
        is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance
        does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were
        a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally
        work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action
        and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films
        is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count
        with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.
        There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered
        by a pistol. I would have loved to see a little bit more variety, but it was
        so in-your-face and absurd that I still had a great time with it.\r\n\r\nScore:

        entertainment, this.\r\n\r\nHappy to have finally got around to watching this
        franchise! I expected sheer enjoyment and that''s what I got. <em>''John Wick''</em>
        is good fun! It is more hammy than I thought it would be, not that that''s
        a criticism. Some characters duck out surprisingly abruptly too (justice for
        Clarke Peters!), even when the one who should get taken out immediately somehow
        manages to stick around for a while.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves is always a pleasure
        to watch act. His character is a badass, that''s for sure. If I''m being truthful,
        none of the others stood out to me too much - not in a negative way, just
        moreso they are all on the same level as each other behind Reeves. Willem
        Dafoe is the best of the rest, though.\r\n\r\nI look forward to checking out
        the sequels, which I''m expecting positive things from - especially with,
        presumably, bigger budgets.","created_at":"2023-02-17T17:59:49.161Z","id":"63efc09535818f0085ea0fa3","updated_at":"2023-02-17T18:00:41.345Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63efc09535818f0085ea0fa3"},{"author":"Rob","author_details":{"name":"Rob","username":"Arcanum101","avatar_path":"/w7CFzleuBl2EMBEl08fSA14aUOy.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"Simply

        you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI
        don’t have a written review for each of the previous films, but I did watch
        both and thoroughly enjoyed them! John Wick (2014) is one of the best movies
        of that year and one of the best action films ever. However, John Wick: Chapter
        2 (2017) is a bit more convoluted and messy regarding its story and how it
        brings our protagonist back into the game, but the franchise’s outstandingly
        choreographed fight sequences still make it tremendously entertaining.\r\n\r\nAnd
        it’s precisely the mind-blowing, bone-crushing, jaw-dropping, extraordinarily
        long and brutally choreographed action scenes that make John Wick one of the
        most badass characters in the history of cinema! The Academy has been looking
        for something new to make the Oscars more popular, and the creation of new
        categories has been their number one idea. Well, nothing fits the show better
        than Best Stunt Work. Obviously, franchises like this one or Mission: Impossible
        would become major successes at this award show. These two sagas are undeniably
        the most important and crucial for the survival of truly real action. What
        you see, it’s what you get.\r\n\r\nNowadays, viewers already have their eyes
        set to acknowledge everything as CGI or some sort of visual effect. I’ll never
        forget when I left my Mission: Impossible - Fallout screening and while getting
        out of the theater, a group of friends was laughing around saying something
        along the lines of “of course that scene is fake and this moment is CGI, how
        can you believe that?! You’re such a moron!” They were roasting one of their
        friends, thinking he was the dumb one when he was probably the one who was
        laughing the hardest. This definitely leaves me sad. Sad that people won’t
        realize how incredible movies like these are. How they genuinely work like
        crazy to provide the audience with real and authentic stunts.\r\n\r\nYes,
        it’s over-the-top. Yes, CGI and visual effects are still applied, but just
        to little details like bullets, blood, falls or knife throwing, which never
        distract you. And yes, it requires the audience to suspend their knowledge
        of physics in a few particular moments. But that’s the thing: if you’re pumped
        to watch a third film of a franchise, you’re a fan. You know what it’s about
        and what’s its tone. John Wick established itself in 2014 as a pure revenge
        story and an unbelievably realistic action movie, the closest we will ever
        get to an assassin origin tale. John Wick: Chapter Two deeply explored the
        institution that governs these assassins and all of the rules that they are
        bound by. It’s a bit messier than the first one, but it’s still a blast of
        entertainment.\r\n\r\nParabellum has the best of both installments. It has
        the best-choreographed action ever seen on a big screen and some of the most
        impressive camera work I’ve ever witnessed. In addition to this, the narrative
        makes more sense, and the characters decisions are logically or emotionally
        justifiable, contrary to the second film. The sound design is powerful, and
        the cinematography plus the set design look stunning. I would still argue
        that the pacing could have been better controlled. The transitions between
        long action sequences and the respective pauses to move the plot forward aren’t
        always smooth. Some comedy bits that I don’t think they really belong in this
        saga were added, and while some work just fine, others really don’t fit this
        world.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I don’t really have much to complain about. The
        cast is absolutely impeccable. Keanu Reeves is battling with Tom Cruise for
        the biggest action movie star alive. While Cruise puts his life more in risk
        by performing especially dangerous stunts, Keanu has the resiliency and agility
        of a beast, providing us with high-speed and hard-to-do fight sequences. Halle
        Berry (Sofia) is one hell of a surprise! I had no idea she was (still) capable
        of moving as she does in this film. The stunts that she performs are crazily
        good! Laurence Fishburne (Bowery King), Ian McShane (Winston) and Lance Reddick
        (Charon) also have their own shining moments, but Sofia‘s dogs are deadly
        cute, and they steal the show.\r\n\r\nRegarding the action stunts, they’re
        all pretty memorable. From a throwback to Chapter Two‘s mirror room to an
        astonishingly riveting chasing scene through the streets of New York, everything
        Chad Stahelski and his talented crew throw at the audience is absolutely perfect.
        I also love how the final act resembles the experience of playing a videogame.
        You know when you have several levels, each of them with their respective
        boss, but the final boss is at the top of them all? It’s kind of like Legend
        of Zelda: Ocarina of Time when Link has to eliminate an enemy in each floor
        in order to move up to the next one until he reaches Ganondorf. It might be
        the must nonsensical analogy that I have, but it’s what my memory triggered.
        In the end, there are tons of set pieces for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\nAll
        in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is everything fans of this franchise
        desired: brutal, bloody, long, loud and beautifully-choreographed fight sequences,
        accompanied by a decent story that explored even more the assassins’ world.
        Chad Stahelski is a master filmmaker, who knows how an action movie should
        be filmed. There are no sloppy editing or quick cuts here. Only extensive
        one-take scenes, filled with outstanding stunt work from a phenomenal cast.
        Keanu Reeves is one of the most incredible action film stars ever and Halle
        Berry surprises with her physical abilities. With better control of its pacing
        and tone (and a bit less defiance of physics), this could have easily been
        the best action movie of the century. “One of the best” it’s still one hell
        of a tagline.\r\n\r\nRating: A-","created_at":"2019-05-17T08:11:16.499Z","id":"5cde6ca40e0a261dd5cb27df","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:22.304Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5cde6ca40e0a261dd5cb27df"},{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Strong

        franchise keeps getting better_**\r\n\r\n>_Igitur qui desiderat pacem, praeparet
        bellum._\r\n\r\n- Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus; _De re militari_ (4th
        or 5th century AD)\r\n\r\n>_It wasn''t just a puppy._\r\n\r\n- John Wick (21st
        century AD)\r\n\r\nDirected by stuntmen turned directors Chad Stahelski and
        David Leitch, and written by Derek Kolstad, the original _John Wick_ (2014)
        was something of a sleeper hit, earning almost $90 million against a $20 million
        budget. The 2017 sequel, however, was a bona fide blockbuster, earning $171
        million against a $40 million budget. And now we have _John Wick: Chapt__er
        3 - Parabellum_, which has maintained the franchise''s monetary trajectory,
        earning $230 million against a $75 million budget. Indeed, _Parabellum_ earned
        more in its opening weekend in North America ($57 million) than the original
        did in its entire North American theatrical run ($43 million). The three films
        were also critical successes, and have come to form the basis for the \"Wickiverse\";
        an expanded universe that includes the forthcoming _Chapter 4_, a spin-off
        prequel film (_Ballerina_), a TV show (_The Continental_), and two video games
        (_John Wick Chronicles_ and _John Wick Hex_).\r\n\r\nNot bad for a franchise
        that began life as a story about a guy getting revenge on the thugs who killed
        his puppy.\r\n\r\nExcept, of course, it wasn''t just a puppy.\r\n\r\nWith
        Stahelski back in the director''s chair for the third time, and with a script
        by Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Marc Abrams, as with the previous
        films, _Parabellum_ is built on the foundation of Sir Keanu of Reeves''s zen-like
        stoicism, a quality he can deploy to make a violent swordfight look about
        as stressful as sleeping on silk linen with \"Fur Elise\" playing in the background
        and a cat gently purring on the pillow beside you. And although this third
        entry in the franchise does flirt with a few themes amidst the mayhem (honour,
        fealty, destiny), it''s not trying to be something it isn''t, well aware of
        its own identity as a completely over-the-top orgy of violence. This is a
        world wherein even the most innocuous of items can be rendered lethal, and
        where the endless deaths by gun, knife, fist, dog, horse, motorbike, sword,
        pencil, and book of 18th century Russian folklore, are so excessive as to
        transcend any possible accusations of irresponsibility or glorification of
        violence. In short, the film leans into its status as basically a live-action
        episode of _Itchy and Scratchy_. Sure, it can become a little repetitive at
        times, and there''s next to no plot or character development, so if you want
        to be reductionist, you could argue that it essentially gives us more of the
        same, except bigger, louder, and more elaborate. But that''s to ignore how
        aesthetically accomplished it is, how funny it is, how compelling it is, and
        how unapologetically entertaining it is.\r\n\r\nBeginning only moments after
        _Chapter 2_ and about a week after _Chapter 1_ (it''s easy to overlook the
        fact that the three _John Wick_ films span two or three weeks at most), _Parabellum_
        opens with legendary assassin John Wick (Reeves) attempting to flee New York.
        Although known as the only assassin ever to have successfully retired from
        the Assassins'' Guild, Wick was pulled back in when the puppy his dead wife
        Helen (Bridget Moynahan) left him was killed by Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen),
        son of powerful Bratva mobster Viggo Tarasov (the late great Michael Nyqvist).
        Having killed both Tarasovs, Wick''s mission of vengeance ultimately led him
        to kill Santino D''Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), the Camorra crimelord who
        helped Wick retire several years prior. D''Antonio was a newly elected member
        of the High Table (the ruling body of the Guild, the members of which are
        considered off limits), and to make matters worse, Wick killed him on the
        grounds of the Continental Hotel (an assassins'' hub in which violence is
        strictly prohibited). Declared \"excommunicado\" by the Table, and with a
        $14 million bounty on his head, Wick''s friend and Continental manager Winston
        (Ian McShane) gives him one hour''s grace before the contract goes live.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,
        the High Table dispatch an Adjudicator (an eerily calm Asia Kate Dillon) to
        look into the unsanctioned help given to Wick by Winston, Continental concierge
        Charon (Lance Reddick), and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), the leader
        of a group of vagrant assassins. Chiding them for helping Wick, the Adjudicator
        gives them seven days to either resign their positions or face the consequences.
        To lead the pursuit of Wick, she hires Zero (a scene-stealing Mark Dacascos),
        a highly-skilled assassin (and part-time sushi chef), who hates guns and is
        a huge fanboy of Wick. With every assassin on the planet hunting him, Wick''s
        travels bring him into contact with a litany of underworld characters - there''s
        The Director (Angelica Huston), a former assassin who trained Wick and who
        currently runs a ballet academy; Sofia (Halle Berry), the manager of the Casablanca
        Continental, and an old friend who owes Wick a marker after he successfully
        hid her daughter away from the Guild; Berrada (Jerome Flynn), the assassins''
        Master of Coin and a member of the High Table; The Elder (Saïd Taghmaoui),
        the only person above the Table, and who Wick hopes may be able to clear the
        bounty; the Tick Tock Man (Jason Mantzoukas), an associate of the Bowery King;
        two of Zero''s pupils (Cecep Arif Rahman and Yayan Ruhian), who insist on
        fighting with honour at all times; and Ernest (Boban Marjanović), a towering
        assassin and Dante Alighieri aficionado.\r\n\r\nOkay, first things first,
        _Parabellum_ looks absolutely gorgeous. I mean really, really gorgeous. _Chapter
        1_ and _Chapter 2_ both looked great, but _Parabellum_ is in another class
        altogether and is genuinely one of the best looking films I''ve seen all year.
        Part of the reason the film looks so good is the symbiosis between the various
        component parts of the aesthetic - the lush cinematography by Dan Laustsen
        (_Le pacte des loups_; _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_; _The Shape
        of Water_); the busy production design and complementary art direction by
        Kevin Kavanaugh (_The Dark Knight Rises_; _Nightcrawler_; _Only the Brave_)
        and Chris Shriver (_The Lovely Bones_; _The Wolf of Wall Street_; _Ocean''s
        Eight_), respectively; the relatively slow editing by Evan Schiff (_Everly_;
        _Revolt_; _Proud Mary_); and the complex sound design by Martyn Zub (_Ghost
        in the Shell_; _Deadpool 2_; _Velvet Buzzsaw_). Everything looks and sounds
        amazing, working in immersive harmony to ensure the action grabs the viewer''s
        attention and doesn''t let go. The first half of the film, which takes place
        at night in New York, and is essentially one long almost real-time scene,
        is rain-soaked and bathed in glorious neon (mainly blues, greens, and reds),
        which reflect off the wetness on the road and bounce back towards their source,
        creating a dazzling display of light. When Wick nips inside a store, the vibrant
        colours are pulled out completely, with the brown of the store''s walls and
        cabinets coming to dominate, so when he heads back outside, the richness of
        the palette really pops. The Moroccan section of the film is predominately
        gold, brown, and yellow, creating a sense of serenity that contrasts nicely
        with the hyperactive tone of the New York scenes which surround it.\r\n\r\nIn
        terms of the action, the film''s opening scene sets the bar insanely high
        – a deadly fight in a library. The visceral brutality of this scene is emphasised
        both visually and aurally; when someone gets slammed against a wall or has
        a hardback book driven into their skull, you really feel the thump on the
        soundtrack, whilst the close-quarters nature of the combat makes for interesting
        shot compositions and editing rhythms (as does the fact that Wick is fighting
        someone over a foot taller than himself). The nature of the fight also leads
        to some inventive uses of the _mise en scène_, as the combatants are forced
        to improvise.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, I was reminded very much of Gareth Evans''s
        _The Raid_ and _The Raid 2_, (the presence of Rahman and Ruhian, who played
        villains in the first _Raid_ film, cannot be a coincidence). These two films
        effectively redefined action cinema by shunning the frenetic editing that
        had become the norm over the previous decade, instead employing longer takes
        that showcased the performers'' physicality. You know that seizure-inducing
        scene in Pierre Morel''s _Taken_ (2008) when Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) jumps
        a fence, and there are literally 15 cuts in five seconds? There''s none of
        that in _Parabellum_, with the editing altogether calmer, allowing the audience
        to focus on the organic progression of the ballet-like hand-to-hand combat,
        creating what can only be described as a symphony of excessive violence. With
        Jonathan Eusebio''s magnificent choreography paying homage to everyone from
        Harold Lloyd to Buster Keaton to Andrei Tarkovsky (seriously), _Parabellum_
        doesn''t just give us rote action scenes, it gives us immersive works of performance
        art.\r\n\r\nHowever, to say that the editing is rhythmic and slower than most
        action movies is not to say that the film is laid back. It isn''t, and it
        includes any number of scenes that really shouldn''t work, so batshit insane
        are they. There''s the initial library fight where books become as deadly
        as knives; a scrap that takes place in an antique knife shop, where Wick and
        his opponents only realise that they''re surrounded by literally hundreds
        of knives when they run out of ammo; a horse versus motorbike gauntlet (with
        swords) on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge that has more than a passing resemblance
        to a similar scene in Jung Byung-gil''s magisterial _Aknyeo_ (2017); an aborted
        confrontation in Grand Central Terminal (damn girl scouts); a huge to-do in
        a Moroccan bizarre involving two people and two dogs against a legion of hired
        thugs; an old-fashioned shootout in the Continental as Wick and Charon face
        down the Adjudicator''s team; and a climactic gunfight cum sword fight in
        a room made entirely of glass. Subtle it isn''t. Entertaining it most certainly
        is. And the fact that the film can pull off such ludicrous scenes without
        becoming a parody of itself is as good a testament to the craft on display
        as anything could be.\r\n\r\nBoth previous _Wick_ films have been said to
        resemble video games in their visual design, although Stahelski has stated
        that this wasn''t a conscious decision, as he has never played a video game.
        Conscious or not, _Parabellum_ is even more indebted to video games than the
        previous films, not just in its aesthetic, but in some of its narrative beats.
        For example, each fight is harder than the last (i.e., the difficulty level
        is increasing), with a few boss fights thrown in for good measure. A scene
        in a stable where Wick uses a horse to take out two thugs is essentially an
        environmental assassination straight out of the _Hitman_ franchise (and Wick
        dresses a lot like Agent 47 too). There''s a single driving level (there''s
        always a single driving level), and a non-combat level where Wick must reach
        his destination before dehydrating. To make it to the final battle, Wick must
        face down a platoon of heavily armoured soldiers, each of whom requires multiple
        hits before going down, whilst Wick himself has to pause at one point for
        a weapon upgrade. Then we have a mini-boss fight, followed by the real boss
        fight against Zero. The narrative is literally structured like a video game,
        and has a similarly insane kill ratio to the previous films (he killed around
        80 in _Chapter 1_, about 130 in _Chapter 2_, and 94 in _Parabellum_). And
        this is not a criticism. On the contrary, part of the film''s charm is its
        resemblance to a violent, hyper-stylized, morally questionable video game
        in which one must kill waves of faceless opponents à la _Doom_ (1993), _Manhunt_
        (2003), or _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ (2004).\r\n\r\nIn terms of the
        acting, a good way to approach it is to ask, who looks at a library book and
        thinks, \"_I could kill someone with this_\"? The answer, of course, is John
        Wick. And the fact that we go along with such insanity is a testament to both
        the film itself and Reeves''s performance, which grounds even the most ridiculous
        of scenes, taking everything in his stride as if it''s the most normal thing
        in the world. His serene monotone delivery is also responsible for easily
        the funniest moment of the franchise thus far. When a thug shoots one of Sofia''s
        dogs (don''t worry, it''s a non-fatal hit), she goes ballistic, laying waste
        to everyone around her, despite knowing that there could be serious consequences.
        Looking at Wick, she points out, by way of explanation/apology, \"_he shot
        my dog_.\" To which Wick replies, in that half-asleep and still stoned from
        the night before surfer-dude voice of Keanu Reeves, \"_I get it_\". That line
        prompted a few people to applaud at the screening I attended. Of course he
        gets it. And so do we.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons the original film stood out
        so much was the subtle brilliance of Kolstad''s world-building. It wasn''t
        just a movie about a former assassin being pulled back into the trade. Instead,
        Kolstad created a fascinating underworld featuring an international Assassin''s
        Guild, a hotel for assassins in which violence is prohibited, and even an
        assassins'' currency. In _Chapter 2_, he expanded this further, introducing
        the person who helped Wick retire, the High Table as the governing body of
        the Guild, blood markers, and the Bowery King, who seems to operate slightly
        outside the purview of the Table. _Parabellum_ continues the expansion, introducing
        the person who trained Wick, the ballet school, the master of coin, the Elder,
        the adjudication process, excommunication, and deconsecration (when a hub
        such as the Continental is declared no longer a safe space and no longer protected
        by the Table). The mythology has deepened with each film, and the fact that
        it has so many religious overtones drives home the sense of old-world ideologies
        being applied to people who must be ultra-modern in how they conduct themselves.\r\n\r\nAre
        there some problems? Well, any film this violent is going to have immediate
        detractors, who will oftentimes speak out against the film without actually
        seeing it, and of course, there will be cries of \"_Hollywood preaches against
        the 2nd Amendment but then makes movies celebrating the destructive power
        of guns_.\" Fair point. But the thing is, the movie doesn''t take itself too
        seriously, nor does it expect the audience to, so the question of its irresponsibility
        when it comes to violence is kind of a moot point. Of course it''s irresponsibly
        violent. It''s supposed to be irresponsibly violent. Does it treat guns and
        knives fetishistically? Yes, to a certain extent it does. But is it celebrating
        guns and violence in a realistic socio-political manner? No, not in the slightest.\r\n\r\nHaving
        said that, there is a sense in which the violence in the film does come across
        as meaningless, insofar as it doesn''t seem to have any practical ramifications
        for any of the main characters. John Wick has literally killed over 300 people
        in the course of a few weeks, but there''s not a hint of any kind of psychological
        consequence. Related to the disassociation that presenting violence like this
        can have, there''s the problem that simply by virtue of logistics, almost
        all of Wick''s opponents are nameless and faceless extras, anonymous hordes
        there to be killed. Indeed, at one point, Wick is literally pursued by two
        busloads of such villains (a bit of meta-commentary on the genre, which I
        personally thought was hilarious). The one criticism that I would definitely
        echo is that the structure of the narrative is a little awkward, and on several
        occasions, actions and decisions reached over the course of multiple scenes
        are simply undone just a couple of scenes later. However, this is a _John
        Wick_ film, not a Marcel Proust novel. The narrative structure is not really
        where your attention is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I don''t
        do blockbusters. I just don''t like them, and can rarely get anything from
        them. I consider the medium of film to be an art form before it is entertainment,
        and I approach every film from that perspective. But attempting to parse a
        summer blockbuster in this manner doesn''t tend to yield much in the way of
        interesting analysis. Nevertheless, every year, there are one or two blockbusters
        that I will go to see. The first such example this year is _John Wick: Chapter
        3 – Parabellum_. And I absolutely loved it. Easily the best in the franchise
        thus far, it''s more ambitious, more ridiculous, more violent, and more entertaining
        than its predecessors. It''s also funnier, and the Wickiverse continues to
        provide a fascinating _milieu_. Sure, themes such as fealty, honour, fate,
        and religion come and go without much engagement. But, as I''ve said, that''s
        not what the film is about. It simply doesn''t follow the rubric to which
        others must try to adhere - character development and motivation, a well-structured
        plot, insightful dialogue, and thematic undercurrents. Instead, Stahelski
        has crafted an action film that features extraordinary aesthetic elements
        and a wonderfully vibrant visual design. _Parabellum_ doesn''t just unapologetically
        revel in its excessive violence. It makes art out of its excessive violence.","created_at":"2019-09-10T22:44:55.823Z","id":"5d782767069f0e113431acf2","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:26.749Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d782767069f0e113431acf2"},{"author":"Per

        clear. This is a movie you watch for the action and not much less. But then,
        that not really a surprise is it?\r\n\r\nThe movie takes off literally minutes
        after the last one ended. John Wick is on the run and that’s the story for
        most of the movie. Well, not entirely. He does have a plan but first he has
        to escape the many assassins trying to cash in the 14 million dollar bounty
        on his head.\r\n\r\nThis movie is all about action. The movie is R-rated although
        I honestly do not understand why. Sure there’s lot of action and a lot of
        killing but still, I wouldn’t say it merits an R-rating and apparently the
        French ratings organisation didn’t either since here in France it France it
        got a 12+ rating. That is, it is only restricted for those younger than 12
        years.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as I wrote above, this movie is all about Keanu Reeves
        and action. Lots and lots of action which usually ends up in one or more persons
        getting killed by John or some of his remaining friends.\r\n\r\nIs the story
        and the action realistic? Hell no! But it is fun to watch even though most
        of the bad guys shoots as accurately as imperial storm troopers. Most of the
        time at least.\r\n\r\nTowards the end I did think it got a bit silly. The
        fight against Zero and his last two students was pretty rubbish. It was kind
        of kick, hack and slash for a few minutes and then stand of and wait until
        the other guy got up again. Then rinse and repeat. Silly indeed.\r\n\r\nAlso,
        they could really tone down on the ludicrous survivability of John Wick. I
        mean, come on! He gets hit by cars and walks away. Not to mention the final
        scene were he falls something like six seven floors, bounces (and I mean bounces!)
        off a fire escape and a trash container and apparently survives.\r\n\r\nI
        probably should rate the movie a star less for that kind of stuff but I wont.
        This is something as refreshing as a Hollywood movie apparently meant to entertain
        and nothing else. There’s really no political or social preaching or any other
        such nonsense which is really rare today. That alone gives it a few extra
        stars in my book.\r\n\r\nThe movie has a 7.7 rating on IMDb at the time of
        writing this which is well deserved, even a bit low. Even the rubbish SJW
        site Rotten Tomatoes claims the movie is “fresh” which is surprising given
        what I wrote above.\r\n\r\nOf course there is a whole bunch of “reviews” that
        claims it is so bad and so on and so forth. Some of these reviews are actually
        repeated several times. That really pisses me off since these people seem
        to write reviews just to complain. It’s the third movie in the Franchise for
        Christ sake! You knew what you were getting yourself into. Don’t watch the
        movie if you do not like these kind of movies. Claiming there is no story
        is bullshit since the first one didn’t really have much more story but then
        the concept was bit more new of course. Some “reviewer” claimed it was the
        worst movie he had ever seen. He cannot have seen many movies then. What a
        load och bollocks!\r\n\r\nBottom line, this was two hours of great entertainment.","created_at":"2019-09-22T06:28:07.659Z","id":"5d871477336e010029163b2d","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:17.462Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d871477336e010029163b2d"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"It''s

        Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum picks up right where the sequel left off, with
        Wick being excommunicated from the assassin underworld. The bounty is set
        at $14 million and Wick has an hour to escape the city before his former associates
        come to collect.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot might not be as strong as the sequel,
        it continues the same story points seamlessly. This film feels more like a
        continuation of larger narrative spanning across franchise, rather than separate
        semi-connected story like the first two. This film is bigger than the last,
        with vast and diverse landscapes for Wick to create havoc in. The lore of
        world is expanded showing us more of the assassin leadership and how the chain
        of command works. All of the new additional characters worked well and were
        integrated into the story perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe action is picked up a notch,
        creating some of the craziest sequences I have ever seen on the screen. The
        fight inside of the knife shop was insane, it left me with my mouth literally
        dropping to the floor. It is one of my favorite action sequences in any film.
        One thing I particularly liked is the sense of desperation and isolation that
        surrounds our main character. We see John Wick tested to the extremes, pushing
        the boundaries resulting in creative stunts and tactics to fight off multiple
        assassins at a time. It was really fantastic. The cinematography was incredible
        here as well. This film shows that with good choreography and a wide shot,
        you can create gripping scenes that do not require fifteen different jump
        cuts. The motorcycle chase has got to be one of the most breathtaking and
        seamless action sequences I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe acting quality sees
        a significant increase in quality when compared to the first two entries.
        Keanu Reeves is still Keanu Reeves, delivering a fairly cheesy and awkward
        performance, but that is what you come to expect and cherish about this franchise.
        The addition of Halle Berry and Asia Dillon were fantastic as the both added
        some serious dramatic acting beats that raised the quality of the film immensely.

        much smashed glass is too much smashed glass? Asking for a friend...\r\n\r\n<em>''John
        Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum''</em> is my favourite of the three films from
        the franchise thus far. It''s longer than any of the preceding two, yet I
        found the pacing in this one to be absolutely spot on. Apart from that, and
        one or two other things, it is similar to its two predecessors - and that''s
        most definitely a major positive. The look of the films are stunning.\r\n\r\nThe
        manic fight scenes remain just as entertaining as before, though I feel like
        here there''s more creativity in using the enviroment around the characters
        - e.g. with the dogs. It felt like more of the fights had a start/end, whereas
        before it seemed all rolled into one - to me, anyway. Not that the latter
        is a bad thing, mind.\r\n\r\nThis entry I think has my favourite scene of
        the entire franchise, and it''s the near the beginning with Reeves'' John
        and Randall Duk Kim''s Doctor. So well shot and edited, made me laugh too!
        There are many good moments in these films, but that''s the standout for me.\r\n\r\nClass
        again is Keanu Reeves, I have nothing more to add to what I''ve said previously
        - perfect actor for the role. Elsewhere, cool to have Ian McShane and Laurence
        Fishburne again, while newcomers Halle Berry, Mark Dacascos and Asia Kate
        Dillon are all pleasing additions to the series.\r\n\r\nThere isn''t a major
        gap in-between these films in my mind. I gave the other two 8/10 ratings,
        but this 2019 release is only narrowly ahead of the flicks from 2014 and 2017.
        More importantly, though, the franchise as a whole is great fun. Bring on
        4 & 5 - and that Berry spin-off, heck gimme the <em>''<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/nobody-2021/\">Nobody</a>''</em>

        Wick has everything an action movie needs.**\r\n\r\nThe combat scenes are
        masterfully choreographed, without those shaky camera moves that most films
        of the genre love to do. We also have glorious kills, without having to appeal
        to unnecessary gore.\r\n\r\nThe plot of this one is a direct sequel to the
        previous movie - which, eventually, is important to the development of this
        trama. The characters are great and well-made, mainly Sofia, whom I particularly
        loved - the movie not only emphasizes her, but her dogs either. And we cannot
        forget Keanu Reeves, that lives the protagonist and make the scenes in such
        an organic way - capitally at his age. Dude was just born to this role.\r\n\r\n_Originally

        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        SPOILERS~\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is an excellent revenge action movie that raises
        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays
        from Keanu.\r\n\r\nMr Wick spends the rest of the film getting even with a
        mob boss for the actions of his son who killed his dog and stole his car.   As
        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films
        like this, they are a rare breed these days!","created_at":"2017-02-25T06:04:18.793Z","id":"58b11e62c3a368075a00616a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:55.050Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58b11e62c3a368075a00616a"},{"author":"Shreyance

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote
        it better, say hitting just the right spots, go treat yourself to this movie.

        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        trope and delivering an incredibly fresh and innovative franchise that delights
        avid action fans and casual observers alike. Chad Stahelski and team break
        free from the now overused shaky cam to hide mediocre acting and push their
        stars and stunt team to give us some of the best action sequences in film
        since The Matrix. But to take this movie even further into brilliance, Stahelski
        prefers to show and not tell the audience about the world in which John Wick
        lives. As a result, everything is mysterious, leaving viewers intrigued, questioning,
        and wholly immersed in this assassin-filled world. The unusual gold coin currency,
        the legend and fear of John Wick, the enigmatic Continental hotel that forbids
        any assassin \"work\" on the premises, and much more sweeten a typical action
        revenge story into a cinematic treasure.","created_at":"2022-08-20T00:29:44.713Z","id":"63002af8dfe31d007b8205a1","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:20:16.102Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63002af8dfe31d007b8205a1"},{"author":"John

        was right. You don''t need to watch 1 and 2 to understand everything that
        is going on in 3. You don''t have to watch 1 to understand 2.\r\n\r\nYou can

        plot doesn''t matter.\r\n\r\nWhat matters is stylized nonstop action. The
        action is hard, fast, and it looks really, REALLY cool.\r\n\r\nThe story is
        absolutely nothing to write home about, but it''s not important to the movie

        Wick is the definition of a blockbuster action film, with big set pieces and
        visceral stunt work that will leave audiences gasping. While the story and
        performances are lacking, the creators make attempts at establishing a greater
        world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore
        that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting
        all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot
        deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there
        is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance
        does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were
        a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally
        work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action
        and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films
        is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count
        with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.
        There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered
        by a pistol. I would have loved to see a little bit more variety, but it was
        so in-your-face and absurd that I still had a great time with it.\r\n\r\nScore:

        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        Reeves is the John Wick of the title, a grieving one man army who gets tipped
        over the edge when gangsters kill his dog. Carnage ensues.\r\n\r\nThe paying
        public do like a good revenge flick, there have been plenty this last couple
        of decades, and they do go down well. Once the set-up has been staged - Wick
        grieves at the loss of his loved one - gets some small joy via a pet - only
        to have that snatched away from him, then the film becomes a joyously unstoppable
        actioner.\r\n\r\nWick, in good hands with a moody and beefy Reeves (face fuzz
        strange, though) strong in presence, cuts a swathe through the gangland eastern
        blockers. And that''s pretty much it! Characterisations are thin on the ground,
        it''s a bit nutty and of course preposterous, but boy is it fun. There you
        go, a box office winning actioner without pretensions.

        SPOILERS~\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is an excellent revenge action movie that raises
        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays
        from Keanu.\r\n\r\nMr Wick spends the rest of the film getting even with a
        mob boss for the actions of his son who killed his dog and stole his car.   As
        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote
        it better, say hitting just the right spots, go treat yourself to this movie.
        You''d be glad.\r\n\r\nAn 8 out of 10","created_at":"2017-05-04T13:09:00.246Z","id":"590b27ecc3a36843a1016ec9","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:56.931Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/590b27ecc3a36843a1016ec9"},{"author":"Sheldon

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        Wick is the definition of a blockbuster action film, with big set pieces and
        visceral stunt work that will leave audiences gasping. While the story and
        performances are lacking, the creators make attempts at establishing a greater
        world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore
        that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting
        all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot
        deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there
        is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance
        does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were
        a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally
        work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action
        and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films
        is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count
        with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.
        There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered
        by a pistol. I would have loved to see a little bit more variety, but it was

        Jedi","avatar_path":null,"rating":9.0},"content":"This is very much my kind
        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some

        SPOILERS~\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is an excellent revenge action movie that raises
        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays
        from Keanu.\r\n\r\nMr Wick spends the rest of the film getting even with a
        mob boss for the actions of his son who killed his dog and stole his car.   As
        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films
        like this, they are a rare breed these days!","created_at":"2017-02-25T06:04:18.793Z","id":"58b11e62c3a368075a00616a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:55.050Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58b11e62c3a368075a00616a"},{"author":"Shreyance

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote
        it better, say hitting just the right spots, go treat yourself to this movie.
        You''d be glad.\r\n\r\nAn 8 out of 10","created_at":"2017-05-04T13:09:00.246Z","id":"590b27ecc3a36843a1016ec9","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:56.931Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/590b27ecc3a36843a1016ec9"},{"author":"Sheldon

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        Wick is the definition of a blockbuster action film, with big set pieces and
        visceral stunt work that will leave audiences gasping. While the story and
        performances are lacking, the creators make attempts at establishing a greater
        world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore
        that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting
        all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot
        deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there
        is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance
        does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were
        a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally
        work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action
        and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films
        is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count
        with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.
        There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered
        by a pistol. I would have loved to see a little bit more variety, but it was

        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        SPOILERS~\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is an excellent revenge action movie that raises
        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays
        from Keanu.\r\n\r\nMr Wick spends the rest of the film getting even with a
        mob boss for the actions of his son who killed his dog and stole his car.   As
        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films
        like this, they are a rare breed these days!","created_at":"2017-02-25T06:04:18.793Z","id":"58b11e62c3a368075a00616a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:55.050Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58b11e62c3a368075a00616a"},{"author":"Shreyance

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote
        it better, say hitting just the right spots, go treat yourself to this movie.

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore

        all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot
        deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there
        is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance
        does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were
        a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally
        work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action
        and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films
        is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count
        with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.
        There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered

        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays

        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI
        don’t have a written review for each of the previous films, but I did watch
        both and thoroughly enjoyed them! John Wick (2014) is one of the best movies
        of that year and one of the best action films ever. However, John Wick: Chapter
        2 (2017) is a bit more convoluted and messy regarding its story and how it
        brings our protagonist back into the game, but the franchise’s outstandingly
        choreographed fight sequences still make it tremendously entertaining.\r\n\r\nAnd
        it’s precisely the mind-blowing, bone-crushing, jaw-dropping, extraordinarily
        long and brutally choreographed action scenes that make John Wick one of the
        most badass characters in the history of cinema! The Academy has been looking
        for something new to make the Oscars more popular, and the creation of new
        categories has been their number one idea. Well, nothing fits the show better
        than Best Stunt Work. Obviously, franchises like this one or Mission: Impossible
        would become major successes at this award show. These two sagas are undeniably
        the most important and crucial for the survival of truly real action. What
        you see, it’s what you get.\r\n\r\nNowadays, viewers already have their eyes
        set to acknowledge everything as CGI or some sort of visual effect. I’ll never
        forget when I left my Mission: Impossible - Fallout screening and while getting
        out of the theater, a group of friends was laughing around saying something
        along the lines of “of course that scene is fake and this moment is CGI, how
        can you believe that?! You’re such a moron!” They were roasting one of their
        friends, thinking he was the dumb one when he was probably the one who was
        laughing the hardest. This definitely leaves me sad. Sad that people won’t
        realize how incredible movies like these are. How they genuinely work like
        crazy to provide the audience with real and authentic stunts.\r\n\r\nYes,
        it’s over-the-top. Yes, CGI and visual effects are still applied, but just
        to little details like bullets, blood, falls or knife throwing, which never
        distract you. And yes, it requires the audience to suspend their knowledge
        of physics in a few particular moments. But that’s the thing: if you’re pumped
        to watch a third film of a franchise, you’re a fan. You know what it’s about
        and what’s its tone. John Wick established itself in 2014 as a pure revenge
        story and an unbelievably realistic action movie, the closest we will ever
        get to an assassin origin tale. John Wick: Chapter Two deeply explored the
        institution that governs these assassins and all of the rules that they are
        bound by. It’s a bit messier than the first one, but it’s still a blast of
        entertainment.\r\n\r\nParabellum has the best of both installments. It has
        the best-choreographed action ever seen on a big screen and some of the most
        impressive camera work I’ve ever witnessed. In addition to this, the narrative
        makes more sense, and the characters decisions are logically or emotionally
        justifiable, contrary to the second film. The sound design is powerful, and
        the cinematography plus the set design look stunning. I would still argue
        that the pacing could have been better controlled. The transitions between
        long action sequences and the respective pauses to move the plot forward aren’t
        always smooth. Some comedy bits that I don’t think they really belong in this
        saga were added, and while some work just fine, others really don’t fit this
        world.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I don’t really have much to complain about. The
        cast is absolutely impeccable. Keanu Reeves is battling with Tom Cruise for
        the biggest action movie star alive. While Cruise puts his life more in risk
        by performing especially dangerous stunts, Keanu has the resiliency and agility
        of a beast, providing us with high-speed and hard-to-do fight sequences. Halle
        Berry (Sofia) is one hell of a surprise! I had no idea she was (still) capable
        of moving as she does in this film. The stunts that she performs are crazily
        good! Laurence Fishburne (Bowery King), Ian McShane (Winston) and Lance Reddick
        (Charon) also have their own shining moments, but Sofia‘s dogs are deadly
        cute, and they steal the show.\r\n\r\nRegarding the action stunts, they’re
        all pretty memorable. From a throwback to Chapter Two‘s mirror room to an
        astonishingly riveting chasing scene through the streets of New York, everything
        Chad Stahelski and his talented crew throw at the audience is absolutely perfect.
        I also love how the final act resembles the experience of playing a videogame.
        You know when you have several levels, each of them with their respective
        boss, but the final boss is at the top of them all? It’s kind of like Legend
        of Zelda: Ocarina of Time when Link has to eliminate an enemy in each floor
        in order to move up to the next one until he reaches Ganondorf. It might be
        the must nonsensical analogy that I have, but it’s what my memory triggered.
        In the end, there are tons of set pieces for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\nAll
        in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is everything fans of this franchise
        desired: brutal, bloody, long, loud and beautifully-choreographed fight sequences,
        accompanied by a decent story that explored even more the assassins’ world.
        Chad Stahelski is a master filmmaker, who knows how an action movie should
        be filmed. There are no sloppy editing or quick cuts here. Only extensive
        one-take scenes, filled with outstanding stunt work from a phenomenal cast.
        Keanu Reeves is one of the most incredible action film stars ever and Halle
        Berry surprises with her physical abilities. With better control of its pacing
        and tone (and a bit less defiance of physics), this could have easily been
        the best action movie of the century. “One of the best” it’s still one hell
        of a tagline.\r\n\r\nRating: A-","created_at":"2019-05-17T08:11:16.499Z","id":"5cde6ca40e0a261dd5cb27df","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:22.304Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5cde6ca40e0a261dd5cb27df"},{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Strong

        or 5th century AD)\r\n\r\n>_It wasn''t just a puppy._\r\n\r\n- John Wick (21st
        century AD)\r\n\r\nDirected by stuntmen turned directors Chad Stahelski and
        David Leitch, and written by Derek Kolstad, the original _John Wick_ (2014)
        was something of a sleeper hit, earning almost $90 million against a $20 million
        budget. The 2017 sequel, however, was a bona fide blockbuster, earning $171
        million against a $40 million budget. And now we have _John Wick: Chapt__er
        3 - Parabellum_, which has maintained the franchise''s monetary trajectory,
        earning $230 million against a $75 million budget. Indeed, _Parabellum_ earned
        more in its opening weekend in North America ($57 million) than the original
        did in its entire North American theatrical run ($43 million). The three films
        were also critical successes, and have come to form the basis for the \"Wickiverse\";
        an expanded universe that includes the forthcoming _Chapter 4_, a spin-off
        prequel film (_Ballerina_), a TV show (_The Continental_), and two video games
        (_John Wick Chronicles_ and _John Wick Hex_).\r\n\r\nNot bad for a franchise
        that began life as a story about a guy getting revenge on the thugs who killed
        his puppy.\r\n\r\nExcept, of course, it wasn''t just a puppy.\r\n\r\nWith
        Stahelski back in the director''s chair for the third time, and with a script
        by Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Marc Abrams, as with the previous
        films, _Parabellum_ is built on the foundation of Sir Keanu of Reeves''s zen-like
        stoicism, a quality he can deploy to make a violent swordfight look about
        as stressful as sleeping on silk linen with \"Fur Elise\" playing in the background
        and a cat gently purring on the pillow beside you. And although this third
        entry in the franchise does flirt with a few themes amidst the mayhem (honour,
        fealty, destiny), it''s not trying to be something it isn''t, well aware of
        its own identity as a completely over-the-top orgy of violence. This is a
        world wherein even the most innocuous of items can be rendered lethal, and
        where the endless deaths by gun, knife, fist, dog, horse, motorbike, sword,
        pencil, and book of 18th century Russian folklore, are so excessive as to
        transcend any possible accusations of irresponsibility or glorification of
        violence. In short, the film leans into its status as basically a live-action
        episode of _Itchy and Scratchy_. Sure, it can become a little repetitive at
        times, and there''s next to no plot or character development, so if you want
        to be reductionist, you could argue that it essentially gives us more of the
        same, except bigger, louder, and more elaborate. But that''s to ignore how
        aesthetically accomplished it is, how funny it is, how compelling it is, and
        how unapologetically entertaining it is.\r\n\r\nBeginning only moments after
        _Chapter 2_ and about a week after _Chapter 1_ (it''s easy to overlook the
        fact that the three _John Wick_ films span two or three weeks at most), _Parabellum_
        opens with legendary assassin John Wick (Reeves) attempting to flee New York.
        Although known as the only assassin ever to have successfully retired from
        the Assassins'' Guild, Wick was pulled back in when the puppy his dead wife
        Helen (Bridget Moynahan) left him was killed by Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen),
        son of powerful Bratva mobster Viggo Tarasov (the late great Michael Nyqvist).
        Having killed both Tarasovs, Wick''s mission of vengeance ultimately led him
        to kill Santino D''Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), the Camorra crimelord who
        helped Wick retire several years prior. D''Antonio was a newly elected member
        of the High Table (the ruling body of the Guild, the members of which are
        considered off limits), and to make matters worse, Wick killed him on the
        grounds of the Continental Hotel (an assassins'' hub in which violence is
        strictly prohibited). Declared \"excommunicado\" by the Table, and with a
        $14 million bounty on his head, Wick''s friend and Continental manager Winston
        (Ian McShane) gives him one hour''s grace before the contract goes live.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,
        the High Table dispatch an Adjudicator (an eerily calm Asia Kate Dillon) to
        look into the unsanctioned help given to Wick by Winston, Continental concierge
        Charon (Lance Reddick), and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), the leader
        of a group of vagrant assassins. Chiding them for helping Wick, the Adjudicator
        gives them seven days to either resign their positions or face the consequences.
        To lead the pursuit of Wick, she hires Zero (a scene-stealing Mark Dacascos),
        a highly-skilled assassin (and part-time sushi chef), who hates guns and is
        a huge fanboy of Wick. With every assassin on the planet hunting him, Wick''s
        travels bring him into contact with a litany of underworld characters - there''s
        The Director (Angelica Huston), a former assassin who trained Wick and who
        currently runs a ballet academy; Sofia (Halle Berry), the manager of the Casablanca
        Continental, and an old friend who owes Wick a marker after he successfully
        hid her daughter away from the Guild; Berrada (Jerome Flynn), the assassins''
        Master of Coin and a member of the High Table; The Elder (Saïd Taghmaoui),
        the only person above the Table, and who Wick hopes may be able to clear the
        bounty; the Tick Tock Man (Jason Mantzoukas), an associate of the Bowery King;
        two of Zero''s pupils (Cecep Arif Rahman and Yayan Ruhian), who insist on
        fighting with honour at all times; and Ernest (Boban Marjanović), a towering
        assassin and Dante Alighieri aficionado.\r\n\r\nOkay, first things first,
        _Parabellum_ looks absolutely gorgeous. I mean really, really gorgeous. _Chapter
        1_ and _Chapter 2_ both looked great, but _Parabellum_ is in another class
        altogether and is genuinely one of the best looking films I''ve seen all year.
        Part of the reason the film looks so good is the symbiosis between the various
        component parts of the aesthetic - the lush cinematography by Dan Laustsen
        (_Le pacte des loups_; _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_; _The Shape
        of Water_); the busy production design and complementary art direction by
        Kevin Kavanaugh (_The Dark Knight Rises_; _Nightcrawler_; _Only the Brave_)
        and Chris Shriver (_The Lovely Bones_; _The Wolf of Wall Street_; _Ocean''s
        Eight_), respectively; the relatively slow editing by Evan Schiff (_Everly_;
        _Revolt_; _Proud Mary_); and the complex sound design by Martyn Zub (_Ghost
        in the Shell_; _Deadpool 2_; _Velvet Buzzsaw_). Everything looks and sounds
        amazing, working in immersive harmony to ensure the action grabs the viewer''s
        attention and doesn''t let go. The first half of the film, which takes place
        at night in New York, and is essentially one long almost real-time scene,
        is rain-soaked and bathed in glorious neon (mainly blues, greens, and reds),
        which reflect off the wetness on the road and bounce back towards their source,
        creating a dazzling display of light. When Wick nips inside a store, the vibrant
        colours are pulled out completely, with the brown of the store''s walls and
        cabinets coming to dominate, so when he heads back outside, the richness of
        the palette really pops. The Moroccan section of the film is predominately
        gold, brown, and yellow, creating a sense of serenity that contrasts nicely
        with the hyperactive tone of the New York scenes which surround it.\r\n\r\nIn
        terms of the action, the film''s opening scene sets the bar insanely high
        – a deadly fight in a library. The visceral brutality of this scene is emphasised
        both visually and aurally; when someone gets slammed against a wall or has
        a hardback book driven into their skull, you really feel the thump on the
        soundtrack, whilst the close-quarters nature of the combat makes for interesting
        shot compositions and editing rhythms (as does the fact that Wick is fighting
        someone over a foot taller than himself). The nature of the fight also leads
        to some inventive uses of the _mise en scène_, as the combatants are forced
        to improvise.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, I was reminded very much of Gareth Evans''s
        _The Raid_ and _The Raid 2_, (the presence of Rahman and Ruhian, who played
        villains in the first _Raid_ film, cannot be a coincidence). These two films
        effectively redefined action cinema by shunning the frenetic editing that
        had become the norm over the previous decade, instead employing longer takes
        that showcased the performers'' physicality. You know that seizure-inducing
        scene in Pierre Morel''s _Taken_ (2008) when Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) jumps
        a fence, and there are literally 15 cuts in five seconds? There''s none of
        that in _Parabellum_, with the editing altogether calmer, allowing the audience
        to focus on the organic progression of the ballet-like hand-to-hand combat,
        creating what can only be described as a symphony of excessive violence. With
        Jonathan Eusebio''s magnificent choreography paying homage to everyone from
        Harold Lloyd to Buster Keaton to Andrei Tarkovsky (seriously), _Parabellum_
        doesn''t just give us rote action scenes, it gives us immersive works of performance
        art.\r\n\r\nHowever, to say that the editing is rhythmic and slower than most
        action movies is not to say that the film is laid back. It isn''t, and it
        includes any number of scenes that really shouldn''t work, so batshit insane
        are they. There''s the initial library fight where books become as deadly
        as knives; a scrap that takes place in an antique knife shop, where Wick and
        his opponents only realise that they''re surrounded by literally hundreds
        of knives when they run out of ammo; a horse versus motorbike gauntlet (with
        swords) on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge that has more than a passing resemblance
        to a similar scene in Jung Byung-gil''s magisterial _Aknyeo_ (2017); an aborted
        confrontation in Grand Central Terminal (damn girl scouts); a huge to-do in
        a Moroccan bizarre involving two people and two dogs against a legion of hired
        thugs; an old-fashioned shootout in the Continental as Wick and Charon face
        down the Adjudicator''s team; and a climactic gunfight cum sword fight in
        a room made entirely of glass. Subtle it isn''t. Entertaining it most certainly
        is. And the fact that the film can pull off such ludicrous scenes without
        becoming a parody of itself is as good a testament to the craft on display
        as anything could be.\r\n\r\nBoth previous _Wick_ films have been said to
        resemble video games in their visual design, although Stahelski has stated
        that this wasn''t a conscious decision, as he has never played a video game.
        Conscious or not, _Parabellum_ is even more indebted to video games than the
        previous films, not just in its aesthetic, but in some of its narrative beats.
        For example, each fight is harder than the last (i.e., the difficulty level
        is increasing), with a few boss fights thrown in for good measure. A scene
        in a stable where Wick uses a horse to take out two thugs is essentially an
        environmental assassination straight out of the _Hitman_ franchise (and Wick
        dresses a lot like Agent 47 too). There''s a single driving level (there''s
        always a single driving level), and a non-combat level where Wick must reach
        his destination before dehydrating. To make it to the final battle, Wick must
        face down a platoon of heavily armoured soldiers, each of whom requires multiple
        hits before going down, whilst Wick himself has to pause at one point for
        a weapon upgrade. Then we have a mini-boss fight, followed by the real boss
        fight against Zero. The narrative is literally structured like a video game,
        and has a similarly insane kill ratio to the previous films (he killed around
        80 in _Chapter 1_, about 130 in _Chapter 2_, and 94 in _Parabellum_). And
        this is not a criticism. On the contrary, part of the film''s charm is its
        resemblance to a violent, hyper-stylized, morally questionable video game
        in which one must kill waves of faceless opponents à la _Doom_ (1993), _Manhunt_
        (2003), or _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ (2004).\r\n\r\nIn terms of the
        acting, a good way to approach it is to ask, who looks at a library book and
        thinks, \"_I could kill someone with this_\"? The answer, of course, is John
        Wick. And the fact that we go along with such insanity is a testament to both
        the film itself and Reeves''s performance, which grounds even the most ridiculous
        of scenes, taking everything in his stride as if it''s the most normal thing
        in the world. His serene monotone delivery is also responsible for easily
        the funniest moment of the franchise thus far. When a thug shoots one of Sofia''s
        dogs (don''t worry, it''s a non-fatal hit), she goes ballistic, laying waste
        to everyone around her, despite knowing that there could be serious consequences.
        Looking at Wick, she points out, by way of explanation/apology, \"_he shot
        my dog_.\" To which Wick replies, in that half-asleep and still stoned from
        the night before surfer-dude voice of Keanu Reeves, \"_I get it_\". That line
        prompted a few people to applaud at the screening I attended. Of course he
        gets it. And so do we.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons the original film stood out
        so much was the subtle brilliance of Kolstad''s world-building. It wasn''t
        just a movie about a former assassin being pulled back into the trade. Instead,
        Kolstad created a fascinating underworld featuring an international Assassin''s
        Guild, a hotel for assassins in which violence is prohibited, and even an
        assassins'' currency. In _Chapter 2_, he expanded this further, introducing
        the person who helped Wick retire, the High Table as the governing body of
        the Guild, blood markers, and the Bowery King, who seems to operate slightly
        outside the purview of the Table. _Parabellum_ continues the expansion, introducing
        the person who trained Wick, the ballet school, the master of coin, the Elder,
        the adjudication process, excommunication, and deconsecration (when a hub
        such as the Continental is declared no longer a safe space and no longer protected
        by the Table). The mythology has deepened with each film, and the fact that
        it has so many religious overtones drives home the sense of old-world ideologies
        being applied to people who must be ultra-modern in how they conduct themselves.\r\n\r\nAre
        there some problems? Well, any film this violent is going to have immediate
        detractors, who will oftentimes speak out against the film without actually
        seeing it, and of course, there will be cries of \"_Hollywood preaches against
        the 2nd Amendment but then makes movies celebrating the destructive power
        of guns_.\" Fair point. But the thing is, the movie doesn''t take itself too
        seriously, nor does it expect the audience to, so the question of its irresponsibility
        when it comes to violence is kind of a moot point. Of course it''s irresponsibly
        violent. It''s supposed to be irresponsibly violent. Does it treat guns and
        knives fetishistically? Yes, to a certain extent it does. But is it celebrating
        guns and violence in a realistic socio-political manner? No, not in the slightest.\r\n\r\nHaving
        said that, there is a sense in which the violence in the film does come across
        as meaningless, insofar as it doesn''t seem to have any practical ramifications
        for any of the main characters. John Wick has literally killed over 300 people
        in the course of a few weeks, but there''s not a hint of any kind of psychological
        consequence. Related to the disassociation that presenting violence like this
        can have, there''s the problem that simply by virtue of logistics, almost
        all of Wick''s opponents are nameless and faceless extras, anonymous hordes
        there to be killed. Indeed, at one point, Wick is literally pursued by two
        busloads of such villains (a bit of meta-commentary on the genre, which I
        personally thought was hilarious). The one criticism that I would definitely
        echo is that the structure of the narrative is a little awkward, and on several
        occasions, actions and decisions reached over the course of multiple scenes
        are simply undone just a couple of scenes later. However, this is a _John
        Wick_ film, not a Marcel Proust novel. The narrative structure is not really
        where your attention is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I don''t
        do blockbusters. I just don''t like them, and can rarely get anything from
        them. I consider the medium of film to be an art form before it is entertainment,
        and I approach every film from that perspective. But attempting to parse a
        summer blockbuster in this manner doesn''t tend to yield much in the way of
        interesting analysis. Nevertheless, every year, there are one or two blockbusters
        that I will go to see. The first such example this year is _John Wick: Chapter
        3 – Parabellum_. And I absolutely loved it. Easily the best in the franchise
        thus far, it''s more ambitious, more ridiculous, more violent, and more entertaining
        than its predecessors. It''s also funnier, and the Wickiverse continues to
        provide a fascinating _milieu_. Sure, themes such as fealty, honour, fate,
        and religion come and go without much engagement. But, as I''ve said, that''s
        not what the film is about. It simply doesn''t follow the rubric to which
        others must try to adhere - character development and motivation, a well-structured
        plot, insightful dialogue, and thematic undercurrents. Instead, Stahelski
        has crafted an action film that features extraordinary aesthetic elements
        and a wonderfully vibrant visual design. _Parabellum_ doesn''t just unapologetically
        revel in its excessive violence. It makes art out of its excessive violence.","created_at":"2019-09-10T22:44:55.823Z","id":"5d782767069f0e113431acf2","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:26.749Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d782767069f0e113431acf2"},{"author":"Per

        Jedi","avatar_path":null,"rating":9.0},"content":"Let’s make one thing perfectly
        clear. This is a movie you watch for the action and not much less. But then,
        that not really a surprise is it?\r\n\r\nThe movie takes off literally minutes
        after the last one ended. John Wick is on the run and that’s the story for
        most of the movie. Well, not entirely. He does have a plan but first he has
        to escape the many assassins trying to cash in the 14 million dollar bounty
        on his head.\r\n\r\nThis movie is all about action. The movie is R-rated although
        I honestly do not understand why. Sure there’s lot of action and a lot of
        killing but still, I wouldn’t say it merits an R-rating and apparently the
        French ratings organisation didn’t either since here in France it France it
        got a 12+ rating. That is, it is only restricted for those younger than 12
        years.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as I wrote above, this movie is all about Keanu Reeves
        and action. Lots and lots of action which usually ends up in one or more persons
        getting killed by John or some of his remaining friends.\r\n\r\nIs the story
        and the action realistic? Hell no! But it is fun to watch even though most
        of the bad guys shoots as accurately as imperial storm troopers. Most of the
        time at least.\r\n\r\nTowards the end I did think it got a bit silly. The
        fight against Zero and his last two students was pretty rubbish. It was kind
        of kick, hack and slash for a few minutes and then stand of and wait until
        the other guy got up again. Then rinse and repeat. Silly indeed.\r\n\r\nAlso,
        they could really tone down on the ludicrous survivability of John Wick. I
        mean, come on! He gets hit by cars and walks away. Not to mention the final
        scene were he falls something like six seven floors, bounces (and I mean bounces!)
        off a fire escape and a trash container and apparently survives.\r\n\r\nI
        probably should rate the movie a star less for that kind of stuff but I wont.
        This is something as refreshing as a Hollywood movie apparently meant to entertain
        and nothing else. There’s really no political or social preaching or any other
        such nonsense which is really rare today. That alone gives it a few extra
        stars in my book.\r\n\r\nThe movie has a 7.7 rating on IMDb at the time of
        writing this which is well deserved, even a bit low. Even the rubbish SJW
        site Rotten Tomatoes claims the movie is “fresh” which is surprising given
        what I wrote above.\r\n\r\nOf course there is a whole bunch of “reviews” that
        claims it is so bad and so on and so forth. Some of these reviews are actually
        repeated several times. That really pisses me off since these people seem
        to write reviews just to complain. It’s the third movie in the Franchise for
        Christ sake! You knew what you were getting yourself into. Don’t watch the
        movie if you do not like these kind of movies. Claiming there is no story
        is bullshit since the first one didn’t really have much more story but then
        the concept was bit more new of course. Some “reviewer” claimed it was the
        worst movie he had ever seen. He cannot have seen many movies then. What a
        load och bollocks!\r\n\r\nBottom line, this was two hours of great entertainment.","created_at":"2019-09-22T06:28:07.659Z","id":"5d871477336e010029163b2d","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:17.462Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d871477336e010029163b2d"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"It''s

        Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum picks up right where the sequel left off, with
        Wick being excommunicated from the assassin underworld. The bounty is set
        at $14 million and Wick has an hour to escape the city before his former associates
        come to collect.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot might not be as strong as the sequel,
        it continues the same story points seamlessly. This film feels more like a
        continuation of larger narrative spanning across franchise, rather than separate
        semi-connected story like the first two. This film is bigger than the last,
        with vast and diverse landscapes for Wick to create havoc in. The lore of
        world is expanded showing us more of the assassin leadership and how the chain
        of command works. All of the new additional characters worked well and were
        integrated into the story perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe action is picked up a notch,
        creating some of the craziest sequences I have ever seen on the screen. The
        fight inside of the knife shop was insane, it left me with my mouth literally
        dropping to the floor. It is one of my favorite action sequences in any film.
        One thing I particularly liked is the sense of desperation and isolation that
        surrounds our main character. We see John Wick tested to the extremes, pushing
        the boundaries resulting in creative stunts and tactics to fight off multiple
        assassins at a time. It was really fantastic. The cinematography was incredible
        here as well. This film shows that with good choreography and a wide shot,
        you can create gripping scenes that do not require fifteen different jump
        cuts. The motorcycle chase has got to be one of the most breathtaking and
        seamless action sequences I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe acting quality sees
        a significant increase in quality when compared to the first two entries.
        Keanu Reeves is still Keanu Reeves, delivering a fairly cheesy and awkward
        performance, but that is what you come to expect and cherish about this franchise.
        The addition of Halle Berry and Asia Dillon were fantastic as the both added
        some serious dramatic acting beats that raised the quality of the film immensely.
        Berry and Wick had some great chemistry together.\r\n\r\nOverall, this film
        is excellent and if each entry can build upon the last like history has shown,
        the sky is the limit for this franchise.\r\n\r\nScore: 87%\r\nVerdict: Excellent","created_at":"2023-02-01T18:22:12.604Z","id":"63daadd43dc31300864cf763","updated_at":"2023-02-01T18:22:12.689Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63daadd43dc31300864cf763"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/mwR7rFHoDcobAx1i61I3skzMW3U.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"How

        Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum''</em> is my favourite of the three films from
        the franchise thus far. It''s longer than any of the preceding two, yet I
        found the pacing in this one to be absolutely spot on. Apart from that, and
        one or two other things, it is similar to its two predecessors - and that''s
        most definitely a major positive. The look of the films are stunning.\r\n\r\nThe
        manic fight scenes remain just as entertaining as before, though I feel like
        here there''s more creativity in using the enviroment around the characters
        - e.g. with the dogs. It felt like more of the fights had a start/end, whereas
        before it seemed all rolled into one - to me, anyway. Not that the latter
        is a bad thing, mind.\r\n\r\nThis entry I think has my favourite scene of
        the entire franchise, and it''s the near the beginning with Reeves'' John
        and Randall Duk Kim''s Doctor. So well shot and edited, made me laugh too!
        There are many good moments in these films, but that''s the standout for me.\r\n\r\nClass
        again is Keanu Reeves, I have nothing more to add to what I''ve said previously
        - perfect actor for the role. Elsewhere, cool to have Ian McShane and Laurence
        Fishburne again, while newcomers Halle Berry, Mark Dacascos and Asia Kate
        Dillon are all pleasing additions to the series.\r\n\r\nThere isn''t a major
        gap in-between these films in my mind. I gave the other two 8/10 ratings,
        but this 2019 release is only narrowly ahead of the flicks from 2014 and 2017.

        you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI
        don’t have a written review for each of the previous films, but I did watch
        both and thoroughly enjoyed them! John Wick (2014) is one of the best movies
        of that year and one of the best action films ever. However, John Wick: Chapter
        2 (2017) is a bit more convoluted and messy regarding its story and how it
        brings our protagonist back into the game, but the franchise’s outstandingly
        choreographed fight sequences still make it tremendously entertaining.\r\n\r\nAnd
        it’s precisely the mind-blowing, bone-crushing, jaw-dropping, extraordinarily
        long and brutally choreographed action scenes that make John Wick one of the
        most badass characters in the history of cinema! The Academy has been looking
        for something new to make the Oscars more popular, and the creation of new
        categories has been their number one idea. Well, nothing fits the show better
        than Best Stunt Work. Obviously, franchises like this one or Mission: Impossible
        would become major successes at this award show. These two sagas are undeniably
        the most important and crucial for the survival of truly real action. What
        you see, it’s what you get.\r\n\r\nNowadays, viewers already have their eyes
        set to acknowledge everything as CGI or some sort of visual effect. I’ll never
        forget when I left my Mission: Impossible - Fallout screening and while getting
        out of the theater, a group of friends was laughing around saying something
        along the lines of “of course that scene is fake and this moment is CGI, how
        can you believe that?! You’re such a moron!” They were roasting one of their
        friends, thinking he was the dumb one when he was probably the one who was
        laughing the hardest. This definitely leaves me sad. Sad that people won’t
        realize how incredible movies like these are. How they genuinely work like
        crazy to provide the audience with real and authentic stunts.\r\n\r\nYes,
        it’s over-the-top. Yes, CGI and visual effects are still applied, but just
        to little details like bullets, blood, falls or knife throwing, which never
        distract you. And yes, it requires the audience to suspend their knowledge
        of physics in a few particular moments. But that’s the thing: if you’re pumped
        to watch a third film of a franchise, you’re a fan. You know what it’s about
        and what’s its tone. John Wick established itself in 2014 as a pure revenge
        story and an unbelievably realistic action movie, the closest we will ever
        get to an assassin origin tale. John Wick: Chapter Two deeply explored the
        institution that governs these assassins and all of the rules that they are
        bound by. It’s a bit messier than the first one, but it’s still a blast of
        entertainment.\r\n\r\nParabellum has the best of both installments. It has
        the best-choreographed action ever seen on a big screen and some of the most
        impressive camera work I’ve ever witnessed. In addition to this, the narrative
        makes more sense, and the characters decisions are logically or emotionally
        justifiable, contrary to the second film. The sound design is powerful, and
        the cinematography plus the set design look stunning. I would still argue
        that the pacing could have been better controlled. The transitions between
        long action sequences and the respective pauses to move the plot forward aren’t
        always smooth. Some comedy bits that I don’t think they really belong in this
        saga were added, and while some work just fine, others really don’t fit this
        world.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I don’t really have much to complain about. The
        cast is absolutely impeccable. Keanu Reeves is battling with Tom Cruise for
        the biggest action movie star alive. While Cruise puts his life more in risk
        by performing especially dangerous stunts, Keanu has the resiliency and agility
        of a beast, providing us with high-speed and hard-to-do fight sequences. Halle
        Berry (Sofia) is one hell of a surprise! I had no idea she was (still) capable
        of moving as she does in this film. The stunts that she performs are crazily
        good! Laurence Fishburne (Bowery King), Ian McShane (Winston) and Lance Reddick
        (Charon) also have their own shining moments, but Sofia‘s dogs are deadly
        cute, and they steal the show.\r\n\r\nRegarding the action stunts, they’re
        all pretty memorable. From a throwback to Chapter Two‘s mirror room to an
        astonishingly riveting chasing scene through the streets of New York, everything
        Chad Stahelski and his talented crew throw at the audience is absolutely perfect.
        I also love how the final act resembles the experience of playing a videogame.
        You know when you have several levels, each of them with their respective
        boss, but the final boss is at the top of them all? It’s kind of like Legend
        of Zelda: Ocarina of Time when Link has to eliminate an enemy in each floor
        in order to move up to the next one until he reaches Ganondorf. It might be
        the must nonsensical analogy that I have, but it’s what my memory triggered.
        In the end, there are tons of set pieces for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\nAll
        in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is everything fans of this franchise
        desired: brutal, bloody, long, loud and beautifully-choreographed fight sequences,
        accompanied by a decent story that explored even more the assassins’ world.
        Chad Stahelski is a master filmmaker, who knows how an action movie should
        be filmed. There are no sloppy editing or quick cuts here. Only extensive
        one-take scenes, filled with outstanding stunt work from a phenomenal cast.
        Keanu Reeves is one of the most incredible action film stars ever and Halle
        Berry surprises with her physical abilities. With better control of its pacing
        and tone (and a bit less defiance of physics), this could have easily been
        the best action movie of the century. “One of the best” it’s still one hell
        of a tagline.\r\n\r\nRating: A-","created_at":"2019-05-17T08:11:16.499Z","id":"5cde6ca40e0a261dd5cb27df","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:22.304Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5cde6ca40e0a261dd5cb27df"},{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Strong

        bellum._\r\n\r\n- Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus; _De re militari_ (4th
        or 5th century AD)\r\n\r\n>_It wasn''t just a puppy._\r\n\r\n- John Wick (21st
        century AD)\r\n\r\nDirected by stuntmen turned directors Chad Stahelski and
        David Leitch, and written by Derek Kolstad, the original _John Wick_ (2014)
        was something of a sleeper hit, earning almost $90 million against a $20 million
        budget. The 2017 sequel, however, was a bona fide blockbuster, earning $171
        million against a $40 million budget. And now we have _John Wick: Chapt__er
        3 - Parabellum_, which has maintained the franchise''s monetary trajectory,
        earning $230 million against a $75 million budget. Indeed, _Parabellum_ earned
        more in its opening weekend in North America ($57 million) than the original
        did in its entire North American theatrical run ($43 million). The three films
        were also critical successes, and have come to form the basis for the \"Wickiverse\";
        an expanded universe that includes the forthcoming _Chapter 4_, a spin-off
        prequel film (_Ballerina_), a TV show (_The Continental_), and two video games
        (_John Wick Chronicles_ and _John Wick Hex_).\r\n\r\nNot bad for a franchise
        that began life as a story about a guy getting revenge on the thugs who killed
        his puppy.\r\n\r\nExcept, of course, it wasn''t just a puppy.\r\n\r\nWith
        Stahelski back in the director''s chair for the third time, and with a script
        by Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Marc Abrams, as with the previous
        films, _Parabellum_ is built on the foundation of Sir Keanu of Reeves''s zen-like
        stoicism, a quality he can deploy to make a violent swordfight look about
        as stressful as sleeping on silk linen with \"Fur Elise\" playing in the background
        and a cat gently purring on the pillow beside you. And although this third
        entry in the franchise does flirt with a few themes amidst the mayhem (honour,
        fealty, destiny), it''s not trying to be something it isn''t, well aware of
        its own identity as a completely over-the-top orgy of violence. This is a
        world wherein even the most innocuous of items can be rendered lethal, and
        where the endless deaths by gun, knife, fist, dog, horse, motorbike, sword,
        pencil, and book of 18th century Russian folklore, are so excessive as to
        transcend any possible accusations of irresponsibility or glorification of
        violence. In short, the film leans into its status as basically a live-action
        episode of _Itchy and Scratchy_. Sure, it can become a little repetitive at
        times, and there''s next to no plot or character development, so if you want
        to be reductionist, you could argue that it essentially gives us more of the
        same, except bigger, louder, and more elaborate. But that''s to ignore how
        aesthetically accomplished it is, how funny it is, how compelling it is, and
        how unapologetically entertaining it is.\r\n\r\nBeginning only moments after
        _Chapter 2_ and about a week after _Chapter 1_ (it''s easy to overlook the
        fact that the three _John Wick_ films span two or three weeks at most), _Parabellum_
        opens with legendary assassin John Wick (Reeves) attempting to flee New York.
        Although known as the only assassin ever to have successfully retired from
        the Assassins'' Guild, Wick was pulled back in when the puppy his dead wife
        Helen (Bridget Moynahan) left him was killed by Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen),
        son of powerful Bratva mobster Viggo Tarasov (the late great Michael Nyqvist).
        Having killed both Tarasovs, Wick''s mission of vengeance ultimately led him
        to kill Santino D''Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), the Camorra crimelord who
        helped Wick retire several years prior. D''Antonio was a newly elected member
        of the High Table (the ruling body of the Guild, the members of which are
        considered off limits), and to make matters worse, Wick killed him on the
        grounds of the Continental Hotel (an assassins'' hub in which violence is
        strictly prohibited). Declared \"excommunicado\" by the Table, and with a
        $14 million bounty on his head, Wick''s friend and Continental manager Winston
        (Ian McShane) gives him one hour''s grace before the contract goes live.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,
        the High Table dispatch an Adjudicator (an eerily calm Asia Kate Dillon) to
        look into the unsanctioned help given to Wick by Winston, Continental concierge
        Charon (Lance Reddick), and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), the leader
        of a group of vagrant assassins. Chiding them for helping Wick, the Adjudicator
        gives them seven days to either resign their positions or face the consequences.
        To lead the pursuit of Wick, she hires Zero (a scene-stealing Mark Dacascos),
        a highly-skilled assassin (and part-time sushi chef), who hates guns and is
        a huge fanboy of Wick. With every assassin on the planet hunting him, Wick''s
        travels bring him into contact with a litany of underworld characters - there''s
        The Director (Angelica Huston), a former assassin who trained Wick and who
        currently runs a ballet academy; Sofia (Halle Berry), the manager of the Casablanca
        Continental, and an old friend who owes Wick a marker after he successfully
        hid her daughter away from the Guild; Berrada (Jerome Flynn), the assassins''
        Master of Coin and a member of the High Table; The Elder (Saïd Taghmaoui),
        the only person above the Table, and who Wick hopes may be able to clear the
        bounty; the Tick Tock Man (Jason Mantzoukas), an associate of the Bowery King;
        two of Zero''s pupils (Cecep Arif Rahman and Yayan Ruhian), who insist on
        fighting with honour at all times; and Ernest (Boban Marjanović), a towering
        assassin and Dante Alighieri aficionado.\r\n\r\nOkay, first things first,
        _Parabellum_ looks absolutely gorgeous. I mean really, really gorgeous. _Chapter
        1_ and _Chapter 2_ both looked great, but _Parabellum_ is in another class
        altogether and is genuinely one of the best looking films I''ve seen all year.
        Part of the reason the film looks so good is the symbiosis between the various
        component parts of the aesthetic - the lush cinematography by Dan Laustsen
        (_Le pacte des loups_; _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_; _The Shape
        of Water_); the busy production design and complementary art direction by
        Kevin Kavanaugh (_The Dark Knight Rises_; _Nightcrawler_; _Only the Brave_)
        and Chris Shriver (_The Lovely Bones_; _The Wolf of Wall Street_; _Ocean''s
        Eight_), respectively; the relatively slow editing by Evan Schiff (_Everly_;
        _Revolt_; _Proud Mary_); and the complex sound design by Martyn Zub (_Ghost
        in the Shell_; _Deadpool 2_; _Velvet Buzzsaw_). Everything looks and sounds
        amazing, working in immersive harmony to ensure the action grabs the viewer''s
        attention and doesn''t let go. The first half of the film, which takes place
        at night in New York, and is essentially one long almost real-time scene,
        is rain-soaked and bathed in glorious neon (mainly blues, greens, and reds),
        which reflect off the wetness on the road and bounce back towards their source,
        creating a dazzling display of light. When Wick nips inside a store, the vibrant
        colours are pulled out completely, with the brown of the store''s walls and
        cabinets coming to dominate, so when he heads back outside, the richness of
        the palette really pops. The Moroccan section of the film is predominately
        gold, brown, and yellow, creating a sense of serenity that contrasts nicely
        with the hyperactive tone of the New York scenes which surround it.\r\n\r\nIn
        terms of the action, the film''s opening scene sets the bar insanely high
        – a deadly fight in a library. The visceral brutality of this scene is emphasised
        both visually and aurally; when someone gets slammed against a wall or has
        a hardback book driven into their skull, you really feel the thump on the
        soundtrack, whilst the close-quarters nature of the combat makes for interesting
        shot compositions and editing rhythms (as does the fact that Wick is fighting
        someone over a foot taller than himself). The nature of the fight also leads
        to some inventive uses of the _mise en scène_, as the combatants are forced
        to improvise.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, I was reminded very much of Gareth Evans''s
        _The Raid_ and _The Raid 2_, (the presence of Rahman and Ruhian, who played
        villains in the first _Raid_ film, cannot be a coincidence). These two films
        effectively redefined action cinema by shunning the frenetic editing that
        had become the norm over the previous decade, instead employing longer takes
        that showcased the performers'' physicality. You know that seizure-inducing
        scene in Pierre Morel''s _Taken_ (2008) when Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) jumps
        a fence, and there are literally 15 cuts in five seconds? There''s none of
        that in _Parabellum_, with the editing altogether calmer, allowing the audience
        to focus on the organic progression of the ballet-like hand-to-hand combat,
        creating what can only be described as a symphony of excessive violence. With
        Jonathan Eusebio''s magnificent choreography paying homage to everyone from
        Harold Lloyd to Buster Keaton to Andrei Tarkovsky (seriously), _Parabellum_
        doesn''t just give us rote action scenes, it gives us immersive works of performance
        art.\r\n\r\nHowever, to say that the editing is rhythmic and slower than most
        action movies is not to say that the film is laid back. It isn''t, and it
        includes any number of scenes that really shouldn''t work, so batshit insane
        are they. There''s the initial library fight where books become as deadly
        as knives; a scrap that takes place in an antique knife shop, where Wick and
        his opponents only realise that they''re surrounded by literally hundreds
        of knives when they run out of ammo; a horse versus motorbike gauntlet (with
        swords) on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge that has more than a passing resemblance
        to a similar scene in Jung Byung-gil''s magisterial _Aknyeo_ (2017); an aborted
        confrontation in Grand Central Terminal (damn girl scouts); a huge to-do in
        a Moroccan bizarre involving two people and two dogs against a legion of hired
        thugs; an old-fashioned shootout in the Continental as Wick and Charon face
        down the Adjudicator''s team; and a climactic gunfight cum sword fight in
        a room made entirely of glass. Subtle it isn''t. Entertaining it most certainly
        is. And the fact that the film can pull off such ludicrous scenes without
        becoming a parody of itself is as good a testament to the craft on display
        as anything could be.\r\n\r\nBoth previous _Wick_ films have been said to
        resemble video games in their visual design, although Stahelski has stated
        that this wasn''t a conscious decision, as he has never played a video game.
        Conscious or not, _Parabellum_ is even more indebted to video games than the
        previous films, not just in its aesthetic, but in some of its narrative beats.
        For example, each fight is harder than the last (i.e., the difficulty level
        is increasing), with a few boss fights thrown in for good measure. A scene
        in a stable where Wick uses a horse to take out two thugs is essentially an
        environmental assassination straight out of the _Hitman_ franchise (and Wick
        dresses a lot like Agent 47 too). There''s a single driving level (there''s
        always a single driving level), and a non-combat level where Wick must reach
        his destination before dehydrating. To make it to the final battle, Wick must
        face down a platoon of heavily armoured soldiers, each of whom requires multiple
        hits before going down, whilst Wick himself has to pause at one point for
        a weapon upgrade. Then we have a mini-boss fight, followed by the real boss
        fight against Zero. The narrative is literally structured like a video game,
        and has a similarly insane kill ratio to the previous films (he killed around
        80 in _Chapter 1_, about 130 in _Chapter 2_, and 94 in _Parabellum_). And
        this is not a criticism. On the contrary, part of the film''s charm is its
        resemblance to a violent, hyper-stylized, morally questionable video game
        in which one must kill waves of faceless opponents à la _Doom_ (1993), _Manhunt_
        (2003), or _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ (2004).\r\n\r\nIn terms of the
        acting, a good way to approach it is to ask, who looks at a library book and
        thinks, \"_I could kill someone with this_\"? The answer, of course, is John
        Wick. And the fact that we go along with such insanity is a testament to both
        the film itself and Reeves''s performance, which grounds even the most ridiculous
        of scenes, taking everything in his stride as if it''s the most normal thing
        in the world. His serene monotone delivery is also responsible for easily
        the funniest moment of the franchise thus far. When a thug shoots one of Sofia''s
        dogs (don''t worry, it''s a non-fatal hit), she goes ballistic, laying waste
        to everyone around her, despite knowing that there could be serious consequences.
        Looking at Wick, she points out, by way of explanation/apology, \"_he shot
        my dog_.\" To which Wick replies, in that half-asleep and still stoned from
        the night before surfer-dude voice of Keanu Reeves, \"_I get it_\". That line
        prompted a few people to applaud at the screening I attended. Of course he
        gets it. And so do we.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons the original film stood out
        so much was the subtle brilliance of Kolstad''s world-building. It wasn''t
        just a movie about a former assassin being pulled back into the trade. Instead,
        Kolstad created a fascinating underworld featuring an international Assassin''s
        Guild, a hotel for assassins in which violence is prohibited, and even an
        assassins'' currency. In _Chapter 2_, he expanded this further, introducing
        the person who helped Wick retire, the High Table as the governing body of
        the Guild, blood markers, and the Bowery King, who seems to operate slightly
        outside the purview of the Table. _Parabellum_ continues the expansion, introducing
        the person who trained Wick, the ballet school, the master of coin, the Elder,
        the adjudication process, excommunication, and deconsecration (when a hub
        such as the Continental is declared no longer a safe space and no longer protected
        by the Table). The mythology has deepened with each film, and the fact that
        it has so many religious overtones drives home the sense of old-world ideologies
        being applied to people who must be ultra-modern in how they conduct themselves.\r\n\r\nAre
        there some problems? Well, any film this violent is going to have immediate
        detractors, who will oftentimes speak out against the film without actually
        seeing it, and of course, there will be cries of \"_Hollywood preaches against
        the 2nd Amendment but then makes movies celebrating the destructive power
        of guns_.\" Fair point. But the thing is, the movie doesn''t take itself too
        seriously, nor does it expect the audience to, so the question of its irresponsibility
        when it comes to violence is kind of a moot point. Of course it''s irresponsibly
        violent. It''s supposed to be irresponsibly violent. Does it treat guns and
        knives fetishistically? Yes, to a certain extent it does. But is it celebrating
        guns and violence in a realistic socio-political manner? No, not in the slightest.\r\n\r\nHaving
        said that, there is a sense in which the violence in the film does come across
        as meaningless, insofar as it doesn''t seem to have any practical ramifications
        for any of the main characters. John Wick has literally killed over 300 people
        in the course of a few weeks, but there''s not a hint of any kind of psychological
        consequence. Related to the disassociation that presenting violence like this
        can have, there''s the problem that simply by virtue of logistics, almost
        all of Wick''s opponents are nameless and faceless extras, anonymous hordes
        there to be killed. Indeed, at one point, Wick is literally pursued by two
        busloads of such villains (a bit of meta-commentary on the genre, which I
        personally thought was hilarious). The one criticism that I would definitely
        echo is that the structure of the narrative is a little awkward, and on several
        occasions, actions and decisions reached over the course of multiple scenes
        are simply undone just a couple of scenes later. However, this is a _John
        Wick_ film, not a Marcel Proust novel. The narrative structure is not really
        where your attention is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I don''t
        do blockbusters. I just don''t like them, and can rarely get anything from
        them. I consider the medium of film to be an art form before it is entertainment,
        and I approach every film from that perspective. But attempting to parse a
        summer blockbuster in this manner doesn''t tend to yield much in the way of
        interesting analysis. Nevertheless, every year, there are one or two blockbusters
        that I will go to see. The first such example this year is _John Wick: Chapter
        3 – Parabellum_. And I absolutely loved it. Easily the best in the franchise
        thus far, it''s more ambitious, more ridiculous, more violent, and more entertaining
        than its predecessors. It''s also funnier, and the Wickiverse continues to
        provide a fascinating _milieu_. Sure, themes such as fealty, honour, fate,
        and religion come and go without much engagement. But, as I''ve said, that''s
        not what the film is about. It simply doesn''t follow the rubric to which
        others must try to adhere - character development and motivation, a well-structured
        plot, insightful dialogue, and thematic undercurrents. Instead, Stahelski
        has crafted an action film that features extraordinary aesthetic elements
        and a wonderfully vibrant visual design. _Parabellum_ doesn''t just unapologetically
        revel in its excessive violence. It makes art out of its excessive violence.","created_at":"2019-09-10T22:44:55.823Z","id":"5d782767069f0e113431acf2","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:26.749Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d782767069f0e113431acf2"},{"author":"Per

        Jedi","avatar_path":null,"rating":9.0},"content":"Let’s make one thing perfectly
        clear. This is a movie you watch for the action and not much less. But then,
        that not really a surprise is it?\r\n\r\nThe movie takes off literally minutes
        after the last one ended. John Wick is on the run and that’s the story for
        most of the movie. Well, not entirely. He does have a plan but first he has
        to escape the many assassins trying to cash in the 14 million dollar bounty
        on his head.\r\n\r\nThis movie is all about action. The movie is R-rated although
        I honestly do not understand why. Sure there’s lot of action and a lot of
        killing but still, I wouldn’t say it merits an R-rating and apparently the
        French ratings organisation didn’t either since here in France it France it
        got a 12+ rating. That is, it is only restricted for those younger than 12
        years.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as I wrote above, this movie is all about Keanu Reeves
        and action. Lots and lots of action which usually ends up in one or more persons
        getting killed by John or some of his remaining friends.\r\n\r\nIs the story
        and the action realistic? Hell no! But it is fun to watch even though most
        of the bad guys shoots as accurately as imperial storm troopers. Most of the
        time at least.\r\n\r\nTowards the end I did think it got a bit silly. The
        fight against Zero and his last two students was pretty rubbish. It was kind
        of kick, hack and slash for a few minutes and then stand of and wait until
        the other guy got up again. Then rinse and repeat. Silly indeed.\r\n\r\nAlso,
        they could really tone down on the ludicrous survivability of John Wick. I
        mean, come on! He gets hit by cars and walks away. Not to mention the final
        scene were he falls something like six seven floors, bounces (and I mean bounces!)
        off a fire escape and a trash container and apparently survives.\r\n\r\nI
        probably should rate the movie a star less for that kind of stuff but I wont.
        This is something as refreshing as a Hollywood movie apparently meant to entertain
        and nothing else. There’s really no political or social preaching or any other
        such nonsense which is really rare today. That alone gives it a few extra
        stars in my book.\r\n\r\nThe movie has a 7.7 rating on IMDb at the time of
        writing this which is well deserved, even a bit low. Even the rubbish SJW
        site Rotten Tomatoes claims the movie is “fresh” which is surprising given
        what I wrote above.\r\n\r\nOf course there is a whole bunch of “reviews” that
        claims it is so bad and so on and so forth. Some of these reviews are actually
        repeated several times. That really pisses me off since these people seem
        to write reviews just to complain. It’s the third movie in the Franchise for
        Christ sake! You knew what you were getting yourself into. Don’t watch the
        movie if you do not like these kind of movies. Claiming there is no story
        is bullshit since the first one didn’t really have much more story but then
        the concept was bit more new of course. Some “reviewer” claimed it was the
        worst movie he had ever seen. He cannot have seen many movies then. What a
        load och bollocks!\r\n\r\nBottom line, this was two hours of great entertainment.","created_at":"2019-09-22T06:28:07.659Z","id":"5d871477336e010029163b2d","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:17.462Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d871477336e010029163b2d"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"It''s

        even Arnie would have been killed. Ian McShane is as wooden as usual; though

        Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum picks up right where the sequel left off, with
        Wick being excommunicated from the assassin underworld. The bounty is set
        at $14 million and Wick has an hour to escape the city before his former associates
        come to collect.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot might not be as strong as the sequel,
        it continues the same story points seamlessly. This film feels more like a
        continuation of larger narrative spanning across franchise, rather than separate
        semi-connected story like the first two. This film is bigger than the last,
        with vast and diverse landscapes for Wick to create havoc in. The lore of
        world is expanded showing us more of the assassin leadership and how the chain
        of command works. All of the new additional characters worked well and were
        integrated into the story perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe action is picked up a notch,
        creating some of the craziest sequences I have ever seen on the screen. The
        fight inside of the knife shop was insane, it left me with my mouth literally
        dropping to the floor. It is one of my favorite action sequences in any film.
        One thing I particularly liked is the sense of desperation and isolation that
        surrounds our main character. We see John Wick tested to the extremes, pushing
        the boundaries resulting in creative stunts and tactics to fight off multiple
        assassins at a time. It was really fantastic. The cinematography was incredible
        here as well. This film shows that with good choreography and a wide shot,
        you can create gripping scenes that do not require fifteen different jump
        cuts. The motorcycle chase has got to be one of the most breathtaking and
        seamless action sequences I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe acting quality sees
        a significant increase in quality when compared to the first two entries.
        Keanu Reeves is still Keanu Reeves, delivering a fairly cheesy and awkward
        performance, but that is what you come to expect and cherish about this franchise.
        The addition of Halle Berry and Asia Dillon were fantastic as the both added
        some serious dramatic acting beats that raised the quality of the film immensely.
        Berry and Wick had some great chemistry together.\r\n\r\nOverall, this film
        is excellent and if each entry can build upon the last like history has shown,
        the sky is the limit for this franchise.\r\n\r\nScore: 87%\r\nVerdict: Excellent","created_at":"2023-02-01T18:22:12.604Z","id":"63daadd43dc31300864cf763","updated_at":"2023-02-01T18:22:12.689Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63daadd43dc31300864cf763"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/mwR7rFHoDcobAx1i61I3skzMW3U.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"How
        much smashed glass is too much smashed glass? Asking for a friend...\r\n\r\n<em>''John
        Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum''</em> is my favourite of the three films from
        the franchise thus far. It''s longer than any of the preceding two, yet I
        found the pacing in this one to be absolutely spot on. Apart from that, and
        one or two other things, it is similar to its two predecessors - and that''s
        most definitely a major positive. The look of the films are stunning.\r\n\r\nThe
        manic fight scenes remain just as entertaining as before, though I feel like
        here there''s more creativity in using the enviroment around the characters
        - e.g. with the dogs. It felt like more of the fights had a start/end, whereas
        before it seemed all rolled into one - to me, anyway. Not that the latter
        is a bad thing, mind.\r\n\r\nThis entry I think has my favourite scene of
        the entire franchise, and it''s the near the beginning with Reeves'' John
        and Randall Duk Kim''s Doctor. So well shot and edited, made me laugh too!
        There are many good moments in these films, but that''s the standout for me.\r\n\r\nClass
        again is Keanu Reeves, I have nothing more to add to what I''ve said previously
        - perfect actor for the role. Elsewhere, cool to have Ian McShane and Laurence
        Fishburne again, while newcomers Halle Berry, Mark Dacascos and Asia Kate
        Dillon are all pleasing additions to the series.\r\n\r\nThere isn''t a major
        gap in-between these films in my mind. I gave the other two 8/10 ratings,
        but this 2019 release is only narrowly ahead of the flicks from 2014 and 2017.
        More importantly, though, the franchise as a whole is great fun. Bring on

        you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI
        don’t have a written review for each of the previous films, but I did watch
        both and thoroughly enjoyed them! John Wick (2014) is one of the best movies
        of that year and one of the best action films ever. However, John Wick: Chapter
        2 (2017) is a bit more convoluted and messy regarding its story and how it
        brings our protagonist back into the game, but the franchise’s outstandingly
        choreographed fight sequences still make it tremendously entertaining.\r\n\r\nAnd
        it’s precisely the mind-blowing, bone-crushing, jaw-dropping, extraordinarily
        long and brutally choreographed action scenes that make John Wick one of the
        most badass characters in the history of cinema! The Academy has been looking
        for something new to make the Oscars more popular, and the creation of new
        categories has been their number one idea. Well, nothing fits the show better
        than Best Stunt Work. Obviously, franchises like this one or Mission: Impossible
        would become major successes at this award show. These two sagas are undeniably
        the most important and crucial for the survival of truly real action. What
        you see, it’s what you get.\r\n\r\nNowadays, viewers already have their eyes
        set to acknowledge everything as CGI or some sort of visual effect. I’ll never
        forget when I left my Mission: Impossible - Fallout screening and while getting
        out of the theater, a group of friends was laughing around saying something
        along the lines of “of course that scene is fake and this moment is CGI, how
        can you believe that?! You’re such a moron!” They were roasting one of their
        friends, thinking he was the dumb one when he was probably the one who was
        laughing the hardest. This definitely leaves me sad. Sad that people won’t
        realize how incredible movies like these are. How they genuinely work like
        crazy to provide the audience with real and authentic stunts.\r\n\r\nYes,
        it’s over-the-top. Yes, CGI and visual effects are still applied, but just
        to little details like bullets, blood, falls or knife throwing, which never
        distract you. And yes, it requires the audience to suspend their knowledge
        of physics in a few particular moments. But that’s the thing: if you’re pumped
        to watch a third film of a franchise, you’re a fan. You know what it’s about
        and what’s its tone. John Wick established itself in 2014 as a pure revenge
        story and an unbelievably realistic action movie, the closest we will ever
        get to an assassin origin tale. John Wick: Chapter Two deeply explored the
        institution that governs these assassins and all of the rules that they are
        bound by. It’s a bit messier than the first one, but it’s still a blast of
        entertainment.\r\n\r\nParabellum has the best of both installments. It has
        the best-choreographed action ever seen on a big screen and some of the most
        impressive camera work I’ve ever witnessed. In addition to this, the narrative
        makes more sense, and the characters decisions are logically or emotionally
        justifiable, contrary to the second film. The sound design is powerful, and
        the cinematography plus the set design look stunning. I would still argue
        that the pacing could have been better controlled. The transitions between
        long action sequences and the respective pauses to move the plot forward aren’t
        always smooth. Some comedy bits that I don’t think they really belong in this
        saga were added, and while some work just fine, others really don’t fit this
        world.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I don’t really have much to complain about. The
        cast is absolutely impeccable. Keanu Reeves is battling with Tom Cruise for
        the biggest action movie star alive. While Cruise puts his life more in risk
        by performing especially dangerous stunts, Keanu has the resiliency and agility
        of a beast, providing us with high-speed and hard-to-do fight sequences. Halle
        Berry (Sofia) is one hell of a surprise! I had no idea she was (still) capable
        of moving as she does in this film. The stunts that she performs are crazily
        good! Laurence Fishburne (Bowery King), Ian McShane (Winston) and Lance Reddick
        (Charon) also have their own shining moments, but Sofia‘s dogs are deadly
        cute, and they steal the show.\r\n\r\nRegarding the action stunts, they’re
        all pretty memorable. From a throwback to Chapter Two‘s mirror room to an
        astonishingly riveting chasing scene through the streets of New York, everything
        Chad Stahelski and his talented crew throw at the audience is absolutely perfect.
        I also love how the final act resembles the experience of playing a videogame.
        You know when you have several levels, each of them with their respective
        boss, but the final boss is at the top of them all? It’s kind of like Legend
        of Zelda: Ocarina of Time when Link has to eliminate an enemy in each floor
        in order to move up to the next one until he reaches Ganondorf. It might be
        the must nonsensical analogy that I have, but it’s what my memory triggered.
        In the end, there are tons of set pieces for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\nAll
        in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is everything fans of this franchise
        desired: brutal, bloody, long, loud and beautifully-choreographed fight sequences,
        accompanied by a decent story that explored even more the assassins’ world.
        Chad Stahelski is a master filmmaker, who knows how an action movie should
        be filmed. There are no sloppy editing or quick cuts here. Only extensive
        one-take scenes, filled with outstanding stunt work from a phenomenal cast.
        Keanu Reeves is one of the most incredible action film stars ever and Halle
        Berry surprises with her physical abilities. With better control of its pacing
        and tone (and a bit less defiance of physics), this could have easily been
        the best action movie of the century. “One of the best” it’s still one hell
        of a tagline.\r\n\r\nRating: A-","created_at":"2019-05-17T08:11:16.499Z","id":"5cde6ca40e0a261dd5cb27df","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:22.304Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5cde6ca40e0a261dd5cb27df"},{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Strong

        bellum._\r\n\r\n- Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus; _De re militari_ (4th
        or 5th century AD)\r\n\r\n>_It wasn''t just a puppy._\r\n\r\n- John Wick (21st
        century AD)\r\n\r\nDirected by stuntmen turned directors Chad Stahelski and
        David Leitch, and written by Derek Kolstad, the original _John Wick_ (2014)
        was something of a sleeper hit, earning almost $90 million against a $20 million
        budget. The 2017 sequel, however, was a bona fide blockbuster, earning $171
        million against a $40 million budget. And now we have _John Wick: Chapt__er
        3 - Parabellum_, which has maintained the franchise''s monetary trajectory,
        earning $230 million against a $75 million budget. Indeed, _Parabellum_ earned
        more in its opening weekend in North America ($57 million) than the original
        did in its entire North American theatrical run ($43 million). The three films
        were also critical successes, and have come to form the basis for the \"Wickiverse\";
        an expanded universe that includes the forthcoming _Chapter 4_, a spin-off
        prequel film (_Ballerina_), a TV show (_The Continental_), and two video games
        (_John Wick Chronicles_ and _John Wick Hex_).\r\n\r\nNot bad for a franchise
        that began life as a story about a guy getting revenge on the thugs who killed
        his puppy.\r\n\r\nExcept, of course, it wasn''t just a puppy.\r\n\r\nWith
        Stahelski back in the director''s chair for the third time, and with a script
        by Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Marc Abrams, as with the previous
        films, _Parabellum_ is built on the foundation of Sir Keanu of Reeves''s zen-like
        stoicism, a quality he can deploy to make a violent swordfight look about
        as stressful as sleeping on silk linen with \"Fur Elise\" playing in the background
        and a cat gently purring on the pillow beside you. And although this third
        entry in the franchise does flirt with a few themes amidst the mayhem (honour,
        fealty, destiny), it''s not trying to be something it isn''t, well aware of
        its own identity as a completely over-the-top orgy of violence. This is a
        world wherein even the most innocuous of items can be rendered lethal, and
        where the endless deaths by gun, knife, fist, dog, horse, motorbike, sword,
        pencil, and book of 18th century Russian folklore, are so excessive as to
        transcend any possible accusations of irresponsibility or glorification of
        violence. In short, the film leans into its status as basically a live-action
        episode of _Itchy and Scratchy_. Sure, it can become a little repetitive at
        times, and there''s next to no plot or character development, so if you want
        to be reductionist, you could argue that it essentially gives us more of the
        same, except bigger, louder, and more elaborate. But that''s to ignore how
        aesthetically accomplished it is, how funny it is, how compelling it is, and
        how unapologetically entertaining it is.\r\n\r\nBeginning only moments after
        _Chapter 2_ and about a week after _Chapter 1_ (it''s easy to overlook the
        fact that the three _John Wick_ films span two or three weeks at most), _Parabellum_
        opens with legendary assassin John Wick (Reeves) attempting to flee New York.
        Although known as the only assassin ever to have successfully retired from
        the Assassins'' Guild, Wick was pulled back in when the puppy his dead wife
        Helen (Bridget Moynahan) left him was killed by Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen),
        son of powerful Bratva mobster Viggo Tarasov (the late great Michael Nyqvist).
        Having killed both Tarasovs, Wick''s mission of vengeance ultimately led him
        to kill Santino D''Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), the Camorra crimelord who
        helped Wick retire several years prior. D''Antonio was a newly elected member
        of the High Table (the ruling body of the Guild, the members of which are
        considered off limits), and to make matters worse, Wick killed him on the
        grounds of the Continental Hotel (an assassins'' hub in which violence is
        strictly prohibited). Declared \"excommunicado\" by the Table, and with a
        $14 million bounty on his head, Wick''s friend and Continental manager Winston
        (Ian McShane) gives him one hour''s grace before the contract goes live.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,
        the High Table dispatch an Adjudicator (an eerily calm Asia Kate Dillon) to
        look into the unsanctioned help given to Wick by Winston, Continental concierge
        Charon (Lance Reddick), and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), the leader
        of a group of vagrant assassins. Chiding them for helping Wick, the Adjudicator
        gives them seven days to either resign their positions or face the consequences.
        To lead the pursuit of Wick, she hires Zero (a scene-stealing Mark Dacascos),
        a highly-skilled assassin (and part-time sushi chef), who hates guns and is
        a huge fanboy of Wick. With every assassin on the planet hunting him, Wick''s
        travels bring him into contact with a litany of underworld characters - there''s
        The Director (Angelica Huston), a former assassin who trained Wick and who
        currently runs a ballet academy; Sofia (Halle Berry), the manager of the Casablanca
        Continental, and an old friend who owes Wick a marker after he successfully
        hid her daughter away from the Guild; Berrada (Jerome Flynn), the assassins''
        Master of Coin and a member of the High Table; The Elder (Saïd Taghmaoui),
        the only person above the Table, and who Wick hopes may be able to clear the
        bounty; the Tick Tock Man (Jason Mantzoukas), an associate of the Bowery King;
        two of Zero''s pupils (Cecep Arif Rahman and Yayan Ruhian), who insist on
        fighting with honour at all times; and Ernest (Boban Marjanović), a towering
        assassin and Dante Alighieri aficionado.\r\n\r\nOkay, first things first,
        _Parabellum_ looks absolutely gorgeous. I mean really, really gorgeous. _Chapter
        1_ and _Chapter 2_ both looked great, but _Parabellum_ is in another class
        altogether and is genuinely one of the best looking films I''ve seen all year.
        Part of the reason the film looks so good is the symbiosis between the various
        component parts of the aesthetic - the lush cinematography by Dan Laustsen
        (_Le pacte des loups_; _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_; _The Shape
        of Water_); the busy production design and complementary art direction by
        Kevin Kavanaugh (_The Dark Knight Rises_; _Nightcrawler_; _Only the Brave_)
        and Chris Shriver (_The Lovely Bones_; _The Wolf of Wall Street_; _Ocean''s
        Eight_), respectively; the relatively slow editing by Evan Schiff (_Everly_;
        _Revolt_; _Proud Mary_); and the complex sound design by Martyn Zub (_Ghost
        in the Shell_; _Deadpool 2_; _Velvet Buzzsaw_). Everything looks and sounds
        amazing, working in immersive harmony to ensure the action grabs the viewer''s
        attention and doesn''t let go. The first half of the film, which takes place
        at night in New York, and is essentially one long almost real-time scene,
        is rain-soaked and bathed in glorious neon (mainly blues, greens, and reds),
        which reflect off the wetness on the road and bounce back towards their source,
        creating a dazzling display of light. When Wick nips inside a store, the vibrant
        colours are pulled out completely, with the brown of the store''s walls and
        cabinets coming to dominate, so when he heads back outside, the richness of
        the palette really pops. The Moroccan section of the film is predominately
        gold, brown, and yellow, creating a sense of serenity that contrasts nicely
        with the hyperactive tone of the New York scenes which surround it.\r\n\r\nIn
        terms of the action, the film''s opening scene sets the bar insanely high
        – a deadly fight in a library. The visceral brutality of this scene is emphasised
        both visually and aurally; when someone gets slammed against a wall or has
        a hardback book driven into their skull, you really feel the thump on the
        soundtrack, whilst the close-quarters nature of the combat makes for interesting
        shot compositions and editing rhythms (as does the fact that Wick is fighting
        someone over a foot taller than himself). The nature of the fight also leads
        to some inventive uses of the _mise en scène_, as the combatants are forced
        to improvise.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, I was reminded very much of Gareth Evans''s
        _The Raid_ and _The Raid 2_, (the presence of Rahman and Ruhian, who played
        villains in the first _Raid_ film, cannot be a coincidence). These two films
        effectively redefined action cinema by shunning the frenetic editing that
        had become the norm over the previous decade, instead employing longer takes
        that showcased the performers'' physicality. You know that seizure-inducing
        scene in Pierre Morel''s _Taken_ (2008) when Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) jumps
        a fence, and there are literally 15 cuts in five seconds? There''s none of
        that in _Parabellum_, with the editing altogether calmer, allowing the audience
        to focus on the organic progression of the ballet-like hand-to-hand combat,
        creating what can only be described as a symphony of excessive violence. With
        Jonathan Eusebio''s magnificent choreography paying homage to everyone from
        Harold Lloyd to Buster Keaton to Andrei Tarkovsky (seriously), _Parabellum_
        doesn''t just give us rote action scenes, it gives us immersive works of performance
        art.\r\n\r\nHowever, to say that the editing is rhythmic and slower than most
        action movies is not to say that the film is laid back. It isn''t, and it
        includes any number of scenes that really shouldn''t work, so batshit insane
        are they. There''s the initial library fight where books become as deadly
        as knives; a scrap that takes place in an antique knife shop, where Wick and
        his opponents only realise that they''re surrounded by literally hundreds
        of knives when they run out of ammo; a horse versus motorbike gauntlet (with
        swords) on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge that has more than a passing resemblance
        to a similar scene in Jung Byung-gil''s magisterial _Aknyeo_ (2017); an aborted
        confrontation in Grand Central Terminal (damn girl scouts); a huge to-do in
        a Moroccan bizarre involving two people and two dogs against a legion of hired
        thugs; an old-fashioned shootout in the Continental as Wick and Charon face
        down the Adjudicator''s team; and a climactic gunfight cum sword fight in
        a room made entirely of glass. Subtle it isn''t. Entertaining it most certainly
        is. And the fact that the film can pull off such ludicrous scenes without
        becoming a parody of itself is as good a testament to the craft on display
        as anything could be.\r\n\r\nBoth previous _Wick_ films have been said to
        resemble video games in their visual design, although Stahelski has stated
        that this wasn''t a conscious decision, as he has never played a video game.
        Conscious or not, _Parabellum_ is even more indebted to video games than the
        previous films, not just in its aesthetic, but in some of its narrative beats.
        For example, each fight is harder than the last (i.e., the difficulty level
        is increasing), with a few boss fights thrown in for good measure. A scene
        in a stable where Wick uses a horse to take out two thugs is essentially an
        environmental assassination straight out of the _Hitman_ franchise (and Wick
        dresses a lot like Agent 47 too). There''s a single driving level (there''s
        always a single driving level), and a non-combat level where Wick must reach
        his destination before dehydrating. To make it to the final battle, Wick must
        face down a platoon of heavily armoured soldiers, each of whom requires multiple
        hits before going down, whilst Wick himself has to pause at one point for
        a weapon upgrade. Then we have a mini-boss fight, followed by the real boss
        fight against Zero. The narrative is literally structured like a video game,
        and has a similarly insane kill ratio to the previous films (he killed around
        80 in _Chapter 1_, about 130 in _Chapter 2_, and 94 in _Parabellum_). And
        this is not a criticism. On the contrary, part of the film''s charm is its
        resemblance to a violent, hyper-stylized, morally questionable video game
        in which one must kill waves of faceless opponents à la _Doom_ (1993), _Manhunt_
        (2003), or _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ (2004).\r\n\r\nIn terms of the
        acting, a good way to approach it is to ask, who looks at a library book and
        thinks, \"_I could kill someone with this_\"? The answer, of course, is John
        Wick. And the fact that we go along with such insanity is a testament to both
        the film itself and Reeves''s performance, which grounds even the most ridiculous
        of scenes, taking everything in his stride as if it''s the most normal thing
        in the world. His serene monotone delivery is also responsible for easily
        the funniest moment of the franchise thus far. When a thug shoots one of Sofia''s
        dogs (don''t worry, it''s a non-fatal hit), she goes ballistic, laying waste
        to everyone around her, despite knowing that there could be serious consequences.
        Looking at Wick, she points out, by way of explanation/apology, \"_he shot
        my dog_.\" To which Wick replies, in that half-asleep and still stoned from
        the night before surfer-dude voice of Keanu Reeves, \"_I get it_\". That line
        prompted a few people to applaud at the screening I attended. Of course he
        gets it. And so do we.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons the original film stood out
        so much was the subtle brilliance of Kolstad''s world-building. It wasn''t
        just a movie about a former assassin being pulled back into the trade. Instead,
        Kolstad created a fascinating underworld featuring an international Assassin''s
        Guild, a hotel for assassins in which violence is prohibited, and even an
        assassins'' currency. In _Chapter 2_, he expanded this further, introducing
        the person who helped Wick retire, the High Table as the governing body of
        the Guild, blood markers, and the Bowery King, who seems to operate slightly
        outside the purview of the Table. _Parabellum_ continues the expansion, introducing
        the person who trained Wick, the ballet school, the master of coin, the Elder,
        the adjudication process, excommunication, and deconsecration (when a hub
        such as the Continental is declared no longer a safe space and no longer protected
        by the Table). The mythology has deepened with each film, and the fact that
        it has so many religious overtones drives home the sense of old-world ideologies
        being applied to people who must be ultra-modern in how they conduct themselves.\r\n\r\nAre
        there some problems? Well, any film this violent is going to have immediate
        detractors, who will oftentimes speak out against the film without actually
        seeing it, and of course, there will be cries of \"_Hollywood preaches against
        the 2nd Amendment but then makes movies celebrating the destructive power
        of guns_.\" Fair point. But the thing is, the movie doesn''t take itself too
        seriously, nor does it expect the audience to, so the question of its irresponsibility
        when it comes to violence is kind of a moot point. Of course it''s irresponsibly
        violent. It''s supposed to be irresponsibly violent. Does it treat guns and
        knives fetishistically? Yes, to a certain extent it does. But is it celebrating
        guns and violence in a realistic socio-political manner? No, not in the slightest.\r\n\r\nHaving
        said that, there is a sense in which the violence in the film does come across
        as meaningless, insofar as it doesn''t seem to have any practical ramifications
        for any of the main characters. John Wick has literally killed over 300 people
        in the course of a few weeks, but there''s not a hint of any kind of psychological
        consequence. Related to the disassociation that presenting violence like this
        can have, there''s the problem that simply by virtue of logistics, almost
        all of Wick''s opponents are nameless and faceless extras, anonymous hordes
        there to be killed. Indeed, at one point, Wick is literally pursued by two
        busloads of such villains (a bit of meta-commentary on the genre, which I
        personally thought was hilarious). The one criticism that I would definitely
        echo is that the structure of the narrative is a little awkward, and on several
        occasions, actions and decisions reached over the course of multiple scenes
        are simply undone just a couple of scenes later. However, this is a _John
        Wick_ film, not a Marcel Proust novel. The narrative structure is not really
        where your attention is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I don''t
        do blockbusters. I just don''t like them, and can rarely get anything from
        them. I consider the medium of film to be an art form before it is entertainment,
        and I approach every film from that perspective. But attempting to parse a
        summer blockbuster in this manner doesn''t tend to yield much in the way of
        interesting analysis. Nevertheless, every year, there are one or two blockbusters
        that I will go to see. The first such example this year is _John Wick: Chapter
        3 – Parabellum_. And I absolutely loved it. Easily the best in the franchise
        thus far, it''s more ambitious, more ridiculous, more violent, and more entertaining
        than its predecessors. It''s also funnier, and the Wickiverse continues to
        provide a fascinating _milieu_. Sure, themes such as fealty, honour, fate,
        and religion come and go without much engagement. But, as I''ve said, that''s
        not what the film is about. It simply doesn''t follow the rubric to which
        others must try to adhere - character development and motivation, a well-structured
        plot, insightful dialogue, and thematic undercurrents. Instead, Stahelski
        has crafted an action film that features extraordinary aesthetic elements
        and a wonderfully vibrant visual design. _Parabellum_ doesn''t just unapologetically
        revel in its excessive violence. It makes art out of its excessive violence.","created_at":"2019-09-10T22:44:55.823Z","id":"5d782767069f0e113431acf2","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:26.749Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d782767069f0e113431acf2"},{"author":"Per

        Jedi","avatar_path":null,"rating":9.0},"content":"Let’s make one thing perfectly
        clear. This is a movie you watch for the action and not much less. But then,
        that not really a surprise is it?\r\n\r\nThe movie takes off literally minutes
        after the last one ended. John Wick is on the run and that’s the story for
        most of the movie. Well, not entirely. He does have a plan but first he has
        to escape the many assassins trying to cash in the 14 million dollar bounty
        on his head.\r\n\r\nThis movie is all about action. The movie is R-rated although
        I honestly do not understand why. Sure there’s lot of action and a lot of
        killing but still, I wouldn’t say it merits an R-rating and apparently the
        French ratings organisation didn’t either since here in France it France it
        got a 12+ rating. That is, it is only restricted for those younger than 12
        years.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as I wrote above, this movie is all about Keanu Reeves
        and action. Lots and lots of action which usually ends up in one or more persons
        getting killed by John or some of his remaining friends.\r\n\r\nIs the story
        and the action realistic? Hell no! But it is fun to watch even though most
        of the bad guys shoots as accurately as imperial storm troopers. Most of the
        time at least.\r\n\r\nTowards the end I did think it got a bit silly. The
        fight against Zero and his last two students was pretty rubbish. It was kind
        of kick, hack and slash for a few minutes and then stand of and wait until
        the other guy got up again. Then rinse and repeat. Silly indeed.\r\n\r\nAlso,
        they could really tone down on the ludicrous survivability of John Wick. I
        mean, come on! He gets hit by cars and walks away. Not to mention the final
        scene were he falls something like six seven floors, bounces (and I mean bounces!)
        off a fire escape and a trash container and apparently survives.\r\n\r\nI
        probably should rate the movie a star less for that kind of stuff but I wont.
        This is something as refreshing as a Hollywood movie apparently meant to entertain
        and nothing else. There’s really no political or social preaching or any other
        such nonsense which is really rare today. That alone gives it a few extra
        stars in my book.\r\n\r\nThe movie has a 7.7 rating on IMDb at the time of
        writing this which is well deserved, even a bit low. Even the rubbish SJW
        site Rotten Tomatoes claims the movie is “fresh” which is surprising given
        what I wrote above.\r\n\r\nOf course there is a whole bunch of “reviews” that
        claims it is so bad and so on and so forth. Some of these reviews are actually
        repeated several times. That really pisses me off since these people seem
        to write reviews just to complain. It’s the third movie in the Franchise for
        Christ sake! You knew what you were getting yourself into. Don’t watch the
        movie if you do not like these kind of movies. Claiming there is no story
        is bullshit since the first one didn’t really have much more story but then
        the concept was bit more new of course. Some “reviewer” claimed it was the
        worst movie he had ever seen. He cannot have seen many movies then. What a
        load och bollocks!\r\n\r\nBottom line, this was two hours of great entertainment.","created_at":"2019-09-22T06:28:07.659Z","id":"5d871477336e010029163b2d","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:17.462Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d871477336e010029163b2d"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"It''s

        even Arnie would have been killed. Ian McShane is as wooden as usual; though

        the John Wick people gave us and nothing more... and each installment of the

        more than an action film, and it never, ever pretends to be anything deeper.\r\n\r\nIt

        Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum picks up right where the sequel left off, with
        Wick being excommunicated from the assassin underworld. The bounty is set
        at $14 million and Wick has an hour to escape the city before his former associates
        come to collect.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot might not be as strong as the sequel,
        it continues the same story points seamlessly. This film feels more like a
        continuation of larger narrative spanning across franchise, rather than separate
        semi-connected story like the first two. This film is bigger than the last,
        with vast and diverse landscapes for Wick to create havoc in. The lore of
        world is expanded showing us more of the assassin leadership and how the chain
        of command works. All of the new additional characters worked well and were
        integrated into the story perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe action is picked up a notch,
        creating some of the craziest sequences I have ever seen on the screen. The
        fight inside of the knife shop was insane, it left me with my mouth literally
        dropping to the floor. It is one of my favorite action sequences in any film.
        One thing I particularly liked is the sense of desperation and isolation that
        surrounds our main character. We see John Wick tested to the extremes, pushing
        the boundaries resulting in creative stunts and tactics to fight off multiple
        assassins at a time. It was really fantastic. The cinematography was incredible
        here as well. This film shows that with good choreography and a wide shot,
        you can create gripping scenes that do not require fifteen different jump
        cuts. The motorcycle chase has got to be one of the most breathtaking and
        seamless action sequences I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe acting quality sees
        a significant increase in quality when compared to the first two entries.
        Keanu Reeves is still Keanu Reeves, delivering a fairly cheesy and awkward
        performance, but that is what you come to expect and cherish about this franchise.
        The addition of Halle Berry and Asia Dillon were fantastic as the both added
        some serious dramatic acting beats that raised the quality of the film immensely.
        Berry and Wick had some great chemistry together.\r\n\r\nOverall, this film
        is excellent and if each entry can build upon the last like history has shown,
        the sky is the limit for this franchise.\r\n\r\nScore: 87%\r\nVerdict: Excellent","created_at":"2023-02-01T18:22:12.604Z","id":"63daadd43dc31300864cf763","updated_at":"2023-02-01T18:22:12.689Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63daadd43dc31300864cf763"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/mwR7rFHoDcobAx1i61I3skzMW3U.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"How
        much smashed glass is too much smashed glass? Asking for a friend...\r\n\r\n<em>''John
        Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum''</em> is my favourite of the three films from
        the franchise thus far. It''s longer than any of the preceding two, yet I
        found the pacing in this one to be absolutely spot on. Apart from that, and
        one or two other things, it is similar to its two predecessors - and that''s
        most definitely a major positive. The look of the films are stunning.\r\n\r\nThe
        manic fight scenes remain just as entertaining as before, though I feel like
        here there''s more creativity in using the enviroment around the characters
        - e.g. with the dogs. It felt like more of the fights had a start/end, whereas
        before it seemed all rolled into one - to me, anyway. Not that the latter
        is a bad thing, mind.\r\n\r\nThis entry I think has my favourite scene of
        the entire franchise, and it''s the near the beginning with Reeves'' John
        and Randall Duk Kim''s Doctor. So well shot and edited, made me laugh too!
        There are many good moments in these films, but that''s the standout for me.\r\n\r\nClass
        again is Keanu Reeves, I have nothing more to add to what I''ve said previously
        - perfect actor for the role. Elsewhere, cool to have Ian McShane and Laurence
        Fishburne again, while newcomers Halle Berry, Mark Dacascos and Asia Kate
        Dillon are all pleasing additions to the series.\r\n\r\nThere isn''t a major
        gap in-between these films in my mind. I gave the other two 8/10 ratings,
        but this 2019 release is only narrowly ahead of the flicks from 2014 and 2017.
        More importantly, though, the franchise as a whole is great fun. Bring on

        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays

        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays

        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        Wick is the definition of a blockbuster action film, with big set pieces and
        visceral stunt work that will leave audiences gasping. While the story and
        performances are lacking, the creators make attempts at establishing a greater
        world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore
        that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting
        all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot
        deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there
        is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance
        does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were
        a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally
        work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action
        and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films
        is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count
        with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.
        There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered
        by a pistol. I would have loved to see a little bit more variety, but it was
        so in-your-face and absurd that I still had a great time with it.\r\n\r\nScore:

        entertainment, this.\r\n\r\nHappy to have finally got around to watching this
        franchise! I expected sheer enjoyment and that''s what I got. <em>''John Wick''</em>
        is good fun! It is more hammy than I thought it would be, not that that''s
        a criticism. Some characters duck out surprisingly abruptly too (justice for
        Clarke Peters!), even when the one who should get taken out immediately somehow
        manages to stick around for a while.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves is always a pleasure
        to watch act. His character is a badass, that''s for sure. If I''m being truthful,
        none of the others stood out to me too much - not in a negative way, just
        moreso they are all on the same level as each other behind Reeves. Willem
        Dafoe is the best of the rest, though.\r\n\r\nI look forward to checking out
        the sequels, which I''m expecting positive things from - especially with,
        presumably, bigger budgets.","created_at":"2023-02-17T17:59:49.161Z","id":"63efc09535818f0085ea0fa3","updated_at":"2023-02-17T18:00:41.345Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63efc09535818f0085ea0fa3"},{"author":"Rob","author_details":{"name":"Rob","username":"Arcanum101","avatar_path":"/w7CFzleuBl2EMBEl08fSA14aUOy.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"Simply

        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        SPOILERS~\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is an excellent revenge action movie that raises
        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays
        from Keanu.\r\n\r\nMr Wick spends the rest of the film getting even with a

        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote
        it better, say hitting just the right spots, go treat yourself to this movie.

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        of action films.**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is a master class on taking every movie
        trope and delivering an incredibly fresh and innovative franchise that delights
        avid action fans and casual observers alike. Chad Stahelski and team break
        free from the now overused shaky cam to hide mediocre acting and push their
        stars and stunt team to give us some of the best action sequences in film
        since The Matrix. But to take this movie even further into brilliance, Stahelski
        prefers to show and not tell the audience about the world in which John Wick
        lives. As a result, everything is mysterious, leaving viewers intrigued, questioning,
        and wholly immersed in this assassin-filled world. The unusual gold coin currency,
        the legend and fear of John Wick, the enigmatic Continental hotel that forbids
        any assassin \"work\" on the premises, and much more sweeten a typical action
        revenge story into a cinematic treasure.","created_at":"2022-08-20T00:29:44.713Z","id":"63002af8dfe31d007b8205a1","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:20:16.102Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63002af8dfe31d007b8205a1"},{"author":"John

        wife made me watch the John Wick series when #3 came out... and I started
        with #3. She was pretty sure that I needed to watch the first two to understand
        what it was about... I was pretty sure that I didn''t.\r\n\r\nTurns out I
        was right. You don''t need to watch 1 and 2 to understand everything that
        is going on in 3. You don''t have to watch 1 to understand 2.\r\n\r\nYou can
        really jump in anywhere you want, and be up to speed withing a few seconds.
        The plot is really that paper thin.\r\n\r\nYou''ve seen movies with plots
        like this before. The tough guy that is the best at what he does goes out
        for revenge. It could be the plot from Taken... from any movie really.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot doesn''t matter.\r\n\r\nWhat matters is stylized nonstop action. The
        action is hard, fast, and it looks really, REALLY cool.\r\n\r\nThe story is
        absolutely nothing to write home about, but it''s not important to the movie
        anyway. That''s not where the fun is. Everything is paper thin, everyone knows
        it is paper thin....\r\n\r\n... because we all realize that this is a start-to-finish
        action extravaganza and things like plots and stories in movies like this
        only really get in the way. Too deep and the movie starts to stink.\r\n\r\nSo,
        what you have is really fun, really exciting, really cool looking action...
        and it''s entertaining. It''s OK to admit that it''s low on plot, because....
        it is what it is, and what it is is super fun and super entertaining.","created_at":"2023-01-11T01:31:12.122Z","id":"63be11605be00e00e7a2839f","updated_at":"2023-01-11T01:31:12.225Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63be11605be00e00e7a2839f"},{"author":"Nathan","author_details":{"name":"Nathan","username":"TitanGusang","avatar_path":"/yHGV91jVzmqpFOtRSHF0avBZmPm.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"John
        Wick is the definition of a blockbuster action film, with big set pieces and
        visceral stunt work that will leave audiences gasping. While the story and
        performances are lacking, the creators make attempts at establishing a greater
        world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore
        that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting
        all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot
        deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there
        is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance
        does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were
        a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally
        work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action
        and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films
        is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count
        with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.
        There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered
        by a pistol. I would have loved to see a little bit more variety, but it was
        so in-your-face and absurd that I still had a great time with it.\r\n\r\nScore:

        entertainment, this.\r\n\r\nHappy to have finally got around to watching this
        franchise! I expected sheer enjoyment and that''s what I got. <em>''John Wick''</em>
        is good fun! It is more hammy than I thought it would be, not that that''s
        a criticism. Some characters duck out surprisingly abruptly too (justice for
        Clarke Peters!), even when the one who should get taken out immediately somehow
        manages to stick around for a while.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves is always a pleasure
        to watch act. His character is a badass, that''s for sure. If I''m being truthful,
        none of the others stood out to me too much - not in a negative way, just
        moreso they are all on the same level as each other behind Reeves. Willem
        Dafoe is the best of the rest, though.\r\n\r\nI look forward to checking out
        the sequels, which I''m expecting positive things from - especially with,
        presumably, bigger budgets.","created_at":"2023-02-17T17:59:49.161Z","id":"63efc09535818f0085ea0fa3","updated_at":"2023-02-17T18:00:41.345Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63efc09535818f0085ea0fa3"},{"author":"Rob","author_details":{"name":"Rob","username":"Arcanum101","avatar_path":"/w7CFzleuBl2EMBEl08fSA14aUOy.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"Simply

        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        Reeves is the John Wick of the title, a grieving one man army who gets tipped
        over the edge when gangsters kill his dog. Carnage ensues.\r\n\r\nThe paying
        public do like a good revenge flick, there have been plenty this last couple
        of decades, and they do go down well. Once the set-up has been staged - Wick
        grieves at the loss of his loved one - gets some small joy via a pet - only
        to have that snatched away from him, then the film becomes a joyously unstoppable
        actioner.\r\n\r\nWick, in good hands with a moody and beefy Reeves (face fuzz

        blockers. And that''s pretty much it! Characterisations are thin on the ground,
        it''s a bit nutty and of course preposterous, but boy is it fun. There you

        SPOILERS~\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is an excellent revenge action movie that raises
        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays
        from Keanu.\r\n\r\nMr Wick spends the rest of the film getting even with a
        mob boss for the actions of his son who killed his dog and stole his car.   As
        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty

        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote
        it better, say hitting just the right spots, go treat yourself to this movie.
        You''d be glad.\r\n\r\nAn 8 out of 10","created_at":"2017-05-04T13:09:00.246Z","id":"590b27ecc3a36843a1016ec9","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:56.931Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/590b27ecc3a36843a1016ec9"},{"author":"Sheldon

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        prefers to show and not tell the audience about the world in which John Wick

        and wholly immersed in this assassin-filled world. The unusual gold coin currency,
        the legend and fear of John Wick, the enigmatic Continental hotel that forbids

        Wick is the definition of a blockbuster action film, with big set pieces and
        visceral stunt work that will leave audiences gasping. While the story and
        performances are lacking, the creators make attempts at establishing a greater
        world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore
        that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting
        all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot
        deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there
        is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance
        does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were
        a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally
        work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action
        and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films
        is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count
        with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.
        There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered
        by a pistol. I would have loved to see a little bit more variety, but it was
        so in-your-face and absurd that I still had a great time with it.\r\n\r\nScore:

        Jedi","avatar_path":null,"rating":9.0},"content":"This is very much my kind
        of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from
        his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie
        might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire
        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        SPOILERS~\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is an excellent revenge action movie that raises
        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays
        from Keanu.\r\n\r\nMr Wick spends the rest of the film getting even with a
        mob boss for the actions of his son who killed his dog and stole his car.   As
        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films
        like this, they are a rare breed these days!","created_at":"2017-02-25T06:04:18.793Z","id":"58b11e62c3a368075a00616a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:55.050Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58b11e62c3a368075a00616a"},{"author":"Shreyance

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.
        So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote
        it better, say hitting just the right spots, go treat yourself to this movie.

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        Wick is the definition of a blockbuster action film, with big set pieces and
        visceral stunt work that will leave audiences gasping. While the story and
        performances are lacking, the creators make attempts at establishing a greater
        world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore
        that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting
        all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot
        deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there
        is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance
        does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were
        a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally
        work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action
        and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films
        is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count
        with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.
        There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered
        by a pistol. I would have loved to see a little bit more variety, but it was

        plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death
        and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from
        her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second
        guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary”
        guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into
        some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun
        in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are
        emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the
        addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe
        plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired
        hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off
        and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big
        bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However,
        such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and
        in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the
        story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves
        is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other
        actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than
        a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background
        that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of
        and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond
        movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so
        you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint.
        There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John
        Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly
        looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness
        and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed
        up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really
        well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is
        that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing
        machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory”
        scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all
        the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements
        that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled
        total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some
        good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly
        pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat
        down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","created_at":"2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:21:14.917Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721"},{"author":"Andres

        SPOILERS~\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is an excellent revenge action movie that raises
        the bar with its excellent lighting, cinematography, and martial arts displays
        from Keanu.\r\n\r\nMr Wick spends the rest of the film getting even with a
        mob boss for the actions of his son who killed his dog and stole his car.   As
        far as the plot goes, its pretty simple but there is a lot of depth to the
        world.\r\n\r\nReeves displays a decent amount of acting range here, but his
        real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time. Its glorious
        to see him smack a guy over the head, hold him down while reloading, and then
        take him out.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the lack of shaky cam--
        you can see all the action happening clearly. This is made possible by the
        dedication of the actors in their martial arts training.\r\n\r\nSupport films
        like this, they are a rare breed these days!","created_at":"2017-02-25T06:04:18.793Z","id":"58b11e62c3a368075a00616a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:55.050Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58b11e62c3a368075a00616a"},{"author":"Shreyance

        unadulterated action**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick - it''s that kind of a character whose
        name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people. And whoever isn''t
        terrified doesn''t mean that they''re better, it just means that they don''t
        know JOHN WICK.\r\n\r\nIt definitely isn''t the first character of it''s kind,
        but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they
        are supposed to be. Let''s just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty
        awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can''t think of anyone else to be John Wick other
        than Keanu Reeves, the guy''s living the character on screen. The hand to
        hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at
        times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn''t too much noise, no
        Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you''d expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe
        cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything
        was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me
        and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great
        action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it''s course.

        cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It''s also stylish, high energy, and
        generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman
        who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here,
        but if you''re squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we''ve heard
        this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat''s different is the world in which
        this takes place. There''s a secret criminal underground that seems to have
        their hands in everything, and there''s a specific code and honor among thieves.
        Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn''t involved
        or in the know somehow, so it''s implied that this society is very widespread
        and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common
        with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart
        of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick
        is that he isn''t a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo,
        he''s not invincible. He''s simply very well trained and determined, which
        makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know
        the outcome, there''s always this little part in the back of your mind that
        wonders if he''ll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic.
        Let''s be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn''t
        have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications
        for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set
        up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane''s
        Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name
        is John; different spelling means it isn''t a shortened version of his name)
        to Lance Reddick''s hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on
        with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there''s a lot of
        ground to explore. It''s not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and
        not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","created_at":"2019-09-21T23:08:31.893Z","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.165Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a"},{"author":"The

        Wick is the definition of a blockbuster action film, with big set pieces and
        visceral stunt work that will leave audiences gasping. While the story and

        world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore
        that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting
        all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot
        deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there
        is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance
        does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were
        a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally
        work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action
        and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films
        is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count
        with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.
        There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered
